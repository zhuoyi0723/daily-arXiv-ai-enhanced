The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, has expanded this integration even further. Because of LLM versatility and ease of use through APIs, these larger models are often utilised even though smaller, custom models can be used instead. In this paper, LLMs and small discriminative models are integrated into a Mendix application to detect Covid-19 in chest X-rays. These discriminative models are also used to provide knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy. This provides a benchmark study of 14 different model configurations for comparison of accuracy and environmental impact. The findings indicated that while smaller models reduced the carbon footprint of the application, the output was biased towards a positive diagnosis and the output probabilities were lacking confidence. Meanwhile, restricting LLMs to only give probabilistic output caused poor performance in both accuracy and carbon footprint, demonstrating the risk of using LLMs as a universal AI solution. While using the smaller LLM GPT-4.1-Nano reduced the carbon footprint by 94.2% compared to the larger models, this was still disproportionate to the discriminative models; the most efficient solution was the Covid-Net model. Although it had a larger carbon footprint than other small models, its carbon footprint was 99.9% less than when using GPT-4.5-Preview, whilst achieving an accuracy of 95.5%, the highest of all models examined. This paper contributes to knowledge by comparing generative and discriminative models in Covid-19 detection as well as highlighting the environmental risk of using generative tools for classification tasks."}

However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training. Our method outperforms several state-of-the-art open-source reward models across diverse STEM benchmarks. We release our codes and model in https://github.com/qianxiHe147/C2RM."}

Despite research showing that domain-dependent, procedural knowledge can dramatically increase planning efficiency, little work evaluates its potential for improving LLM performance on agentic tasks that may require implicit planning. We formalize, implement, and evaluate an agentic LLM workflow that leverages procedural knowledge in the form of a hierarchical task network (HTN). Empirical results of our implementation show that hand-coded HTNs can dramatically improve LLM performance on agentic tasks, and using HTNs can boost a 20b or 70b parameter LLM to outperform a much larger 120b parameter LLM baseline. Furthermore, LLM-created HTNs improve overall performance, though less so. The results suggest that leveraging expertise--from humans, documents, or LLMs--to curate procedural knowledge will become another important tool for improving LLM workflows."}

We systematically investigate the effects of query characteristics and metadata integration strategies on retrieval quality, answer generation, and the performance of the overall system.

The framework operates in three stages: (1) transforming video content into fine-grained captions using a vision-language model, (2) constructing structured knowledge by organizing the captions into four semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), and (3) generating slot-wise explanations that reveal which semantic factors contribute most to the anomaly decision.

Yet current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting or decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. As a result, existing methods fail to capture the iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex user queries demand. We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks.

Unlike standard scientific reasoning or general creative generation, idea generation in science is a multi-objective and open-ended task, where the novelty of a contribution is as essential as its empirical soundness. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising generators of scientific ideas, capable of producing coherent and factual outputs with surprising intuition and acceptable reasoning, yet their creative capacity remains inconsistent and poorly understood. This survey provides a structured synthesis of methods for LLM-driven scientific ideation, examining how different approaches balance creativity with scientific soundness. We categorize existing methods into five complementary families: External knowledge augmentation, Prompt-based distributional steering, Inference-time scaling, Multi-agent collaboration, and Parameter-level adaptation. To interpret their contributions, we employ two complementary frameworks: Boden's taxonomy of Combinatorial, Exploratory and Transformational creativity to characterize the level of ideas each family expected to generate, and Rhodes' 4Ps framework-Person, Process, Press, and Product-to locate the aspect or source of creativity that each method emphasizes. By aligning methodological advances with creativity frameworks, this survey clarifies the state of the field and outlines key directions toward reliable, systematic, and transformative applications of LLMs in scientific discovery."}

We prove that these moments generically uniquely determine the underlying structure, up to a global rotation and reflection, and we develop a convex-relaxation-based algorithm that achieves accurate recovery using only second-order statistics.

Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \\cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \\textbf{20\\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \\textbf{51\\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably.

However, adapting LLMs to effectively handle structural data, such as knowledge graphs or web data, remains a challenging problem. Some approaches adopt complex strategies to convert graphs into text sequences, resulting in significant token overhead and rendering them impractical for large-scale graphs. Others introduce additional modules to encode graphs into fixed-size token representations for LLMs. However, these methods typically require large-scale post-training on graph-text corpus and complex alignment procedures, yet often yield sub-optimal results due to poor modality alignment. Inspired by in-parameter knowledge injection for test-time adaptation of LLMs, we propose GRIP, a novel framework that equips LLMs with the ability to internalize complex relational information from graphs through carefully designed fine-tuning tasks. This knowledge is efficiently stored within lightweight LoRA parameters, enabling the fine-tuned LLM to perform a wide range of graph-related tasks without requiring access to the original graph at inference time. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach."}

Modulo cameras address this by folding incident irradiance into a bounded range, yet require specialized unwrapping algorithms to reconstruct the underlying signal. Unlike HDR recovery, which extends dynamic range from conventional sampling, modulo recovery restores actual values from folded samples. Despite being introduced over a decade ago, progress in modulo image recovery has been slow, especially in the use of modern deep learning techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that standard HDR methods are unsuitable for modulo recovery. Transformers, however, can capture global dependencies and spatial-temporal relationships crucial for resolving folded video frames. Still, adapting existing Transformer architectures for modulo recovery demands novel techniques. To this end, we present Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (SSViT), the first deep learning framework for modulo video reconstruction. SSViT employs a token selection strategy to improve efficiency and concentrate on the most critical regions. Experiments confirm that SSViT produces high-quality reconstructions from 8-bit folded videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance in modulo video recovery."}

Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.\n  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.\n  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late."}

In this work, we propose Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance (ASAG), a novel method that reinterprets attention scores in diffusion models through the lens of optimal transport and intentionally disrupt the transport cost via Sinkhorn algorithm. Instead of naively corrupting the attention mechanism, ASAG injects an adversarial cost within self-attention layers to reduce pixel-wise similarity between queries and keys. This deliberate degradation weakens misleading attention alignments and leads to improved conditional and unconditional sample quality. ASAG shows consistent improvements in text-to-image diffusion, and enhances controllability and fidelity in downstream applications such as IP-Adapter and ControlNet.

It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information. Our results highlight the need for robust, scalable assessment of deep research capabilities, to which end we release ResearchRubrics(including all prompts, rubrics, and evaluation code) to facilitate progress toward well-justified research assistants."}

Meanwhile, efforts to interpret their internal mechanisms have emerged, offering insights to enhance multilingual performance. While multi-head self-attention (MHA) has proven critical in many areas, its role in multilingual capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we study the contribution of MHA in supporting multilingual processing in LLMs. We propose Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS), an effective and efficient method that identifies attention head importance for multilingual capabilities via a single forward and backward pass through the LLM. Applying LAHIS to Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1, we reveal the existence of both language-specific and language-general heads. Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer to guide the model toward target language contexts and mitigate off-target language generation issue, contributing to addressing challenges in multilingual LLMs. We also introduce a lightweight adaptation that learns a soft head mask to modulate attention outputs over language heads, requiring only 20 tunable parameters to improve XQuAD accuracy. Overall, our work enhances both the interpretability and multilingual capabilities of LLMs from the perspective of MHA."}

While several specialised toolkits provide high performance for specific tasks, using existing tools still requires substantial technical expertise. There remains a gap in accessible, integrated solutions that deliver sufficient tracking for non-experts across diverse settings.\n  TrackStudio was developed to address this gap by combining established open-source tools into a single, modular, GUI-based pipeline that works out of the box. It provides automatic 2D and 3D tracking, calibration, preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualisation without requiring any programming skills. We supply a user guide with practical advice for video acquisition, synchronisation, and setup, alongside documentation of common pitfalls and how to avoid them.\n  To validate the toolkit, we tested its performance across three environments using either low-cost webcams or high-resolution cameras, including challenging conditions for body position, lightning, and space and obstructions. Across 76 participants, average inter-frame correlations exceeded 0.98 and average triangulation errors remained low (<13.6mm for hand tracking), demonstrating stable and consistent tracking. We further show that the same pipeline can be extended beyond hand tracking to other body and face regions. TrackStudio provides a practical, accessible route into markerless tracking for researchers or laypeople who need reliable performance without specialist expertise."}

Although prior research explored scenario generation for military training, pre-LLM AI tools struggled to generate sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios. This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training."}

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reranking tasks. In particular, Pairwise Reranking Prompting (PRP) has emerged as a promising plug-and-play approach due to its usability and effectiveness. However, the inherent complexity of the algorithm, coupled with the high computational demands and latency incurred due to LLMs, raises concerns about its feasibility in real-time applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a focused study on pairwise reranking, demonstrating that carefully applied optimization methods can significantly mitigate these issues. By implementing these methods, we achieve a remarkable latency reduction of up to 166 times, from 61.36 seconds to 0.37 seconds per query, with an insignificant drop in performance measured by Recall@k. Our study highlights the importance of design choices that were previously overlooked, such as using smaller models, limiting the reranked set, using lower precision, reducing positional bias with one-directional order inference, and restricting output tokens. These optimizations make LLM-based reranking substantially more efficient and feasible for latency-sensitive, real-world deployments."}

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is a powerful tool to stratify the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Current scoring practices require time-intensive semiautomatic analysis of cardiac computed tomography by radiologists and trained radiographers. The purpose of this study is to develop a deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) model to classify the calcium score in cardiac, non-contrast computed tomography images into one of six clinical categories. A total of 68 patient scans were retrospectively obtained together with their respective reported semiautomatic calcium score using an ECG-gated GE Discovery 570 Cardiac SPECT/CT camera. The dataset was divided into training, validation and test sets. Using the semiautomatic CAC score as the reference label, the model demonstrated high performance on a six-class CAC scoring categorisation task. Of the scans analysed, the model misclassified 32 cases, tending towards overestimating the CAC in 26 out of 32 misclassifications. Overall, the model showed high agreement (Cohen's kappa of 0.962), an overall accuracy of 96.5% and high generalisability. The results suggest that the model outputs were accurate and consistent with current semiautomatic practice, with good generalisability to test data. The model demonstrates the viability of a CNN model to stratify the calcium score into an expanded set of six clinical categories."}

While satellite-based imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT, PRISMA, and EnMAP, can detect these point sources, current methane retrieval methods based on matched filters still produce a high number of false detections requiring laborious manual verification. This paper describes the operational deployment of a machine learning system for detecting methane emissions within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) of the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We created the largest and most diverse global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions and quantitatively compared different deep learning model configurations. Focusing on the requirements for operational deployment, we extended prior evaluation methodologies from small tiled datasets to full granule evaluation. This revealed that deep learning models still produce a large number of false detections, a problem we address with model ensembling, which reduced false detections by over 74%. Deployed in the MARS pipeline, our system processes scenes and proposes plumes to analysts, accelerating the detection and analysis process. During seven months of operational deployment, it facilitated the verification of 1,351 distinct methane leaks, resulting in 479 stakeholder notifications. We further demonstrate the model's utility in verifying mitigation success through case studies in Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan. Our work represents a critical step towards a global AI-assisted methane leak detection system, which is required to process the dramatically higher data volumes expected from new and current imaging spectrometers."}

Our dataset comprised approximately 25000 spontaneous textual responses from 102 Dutch-speaking participants, each providing narratives about their current experiences with self-assessed valence ratings (-50 to +50).

Includes 7 pages of supplementary material", "summary": "Safety and efficiency are both important factors when deploying large language models(LLMs). LLMs are trained to follow human alignment for safety, and post training quantization(PTQ) is applied afterward for efficiency. However, these two objectives are often in conflict, revealing a fundamental flaw in the conventional PTQ paradigm: quantization can turn into a safety vulnerability if it only aims to achieve low perplexity. Models can demonstrate low perplexity yet exhibit significant degradation in alignment with the safety policy, highlighting that perplexity alone is an insufficient and often misleading proxy for model safety. To address this, we propose Alignment-Aware Quantization(AAQ), a novel approach that integrates Alignment-Preserving Contrastive(APC) loss into the PTQ pipeline. Compared to simple reconstruction loss, ours explicitly preserves alignment by encouraging the quantized model to mimic its safe, instruction-tuned model while diverging from the unaligned, pre-trained counterpart. Our method achieves this robust safety alignment without resorting to specialized safety-focused calibration datasets, highlighting its practical utility and broad applicability. AAQ is compatible with standard PTQ techniques and enables robust 4-bit (W4A4) quantization across diverse model families such as LLaMA, Qwen, and Mistral while maintaining safety where previous methods fail. Our work resolves the critical trade-off between efficiency and safety, paving the way toward LLMs that are both efficient and trustworthy.

Unlike global alignment, fine-grained alignment requires precise correspondence between localized visual regions and textual tokens, often hindered by noisy attention mechanisms and oversimplified modeling of cross-modal relationships. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing approaches: the lack of robust intra-modal mechanisms to assess the significance of visual and textual tokens, leading to poor generalization in complex scenes; and the absence of fine-grained uncertainty modeling, which fails to capture the one-to-many and many-to-one nature of region-word correspondences. To address these issues, we propose a unified approach that incorporates significance-aware and granularity-aware modeling and region-level uncertainty modeling. Our method leverages modality-specific biases to identify salient features without relying on brittle cross-modal attention, and represents region features as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to capture fine-grained uncertainty. Extensive experiments on Flickr30K and MS-COCO demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across various backbone architectures, significantly enhancing the robustness and interpretability of fine-grained image-text alignment."}

A gated fusion mechanism further integrates the multi-modal representations into a structured state, enabling the policy to make informed and generalizable operator selection decisions.

We probe metric robustness through seven factuality-preserving perturbations applied to summaries, namely paraphrasing, simplification, synonym replacement, logically equivalent negations, vocabulary reduction, compression, and source text insertion, and further analyze their sensitivity to retrieval context and claim information density. Across three long-form benchmark datasets spanning science fiction, legal, and scientific domains, our results reveal that existing short-form metrics produce inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and exhibit declining reliability for information-dense claims whose content is semantically similar to many parts of the source document. While expanding the retrieval context improves stability in some domains, no metric consistently maintains factual alignment under long-context conditions.

This is the extended preprint version including appendices", "summary": "Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis.

By modulating the learning signal according to the confidence in each preference pair, CAPO enhances robustness to noisy or low-margin comparisons, typically encountered in multilingual text.

Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors. These results highlight the feasibility of EEG-based assistive systems capable of supporting real-world, imperfect speech conditions in aphasia patients."}

The effects of the predictability of a word given its previous context are generally well-understood in both production and comprehension, but studies of naturalistic production have also revealed a poorly-understood backward predictability effect of a word given its future context, which may be related to future planning. Here, in two studies of naturalistic speech corpora, we investigate backward predictability effects using improved measures and more powerful language models, introducing a new principled and conceptually motivated information-theoretic predictability measure that integrates predictability from both the future and the past context. Our first study revisits classic predictability effects on word duration. Our second study investigates substitution errors within a generative framework that independently models the effects of lexical, contextual, and communicative factors on word choice, while predicting the actual words that surface as speech errors. We find that our proposed conceptually-motivated alternative to backward predictability yields qualitatively similar effects across both studies. Through a fine-grained analysis of substitution errors, we further show that different kinds of errors are suggestive of how speakers prioritize form, meaning, and context-based information during lexical planning. Together, these findings illuminate the functional roles of past and future context in how speakers encode and choose words, offering a bridge between contextual predictability effects and the mechanisms of sentence planning."}

To mitigate the above issues, we propose Prototype-Guided Calibration Distillation (PGCD) and Dual-Aligned Prototype Distillation (DAPD) for CIMIS in this paper. Specifically, PGCD exploits prototype-to-feature similarity to calibrate class-specific distillation intensity in different spatial regions, effectively reinforcing reliable old knowledge and suppressing misleading information from old classes. Complementarily, DAPD aligns the local prototypes of old classes extracted from the current model with both global prototypes and local prototypes, further enhancing segmentation performance on old categories.

SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment."}

Based on this benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted on 11 mainstream large language models. The evaluation results reveal that general-purpose models suffer from common bottlenecks such as weak actuarial capabilities and inadequate compliance adaptation. High-quality domain-specific training demonstrates significant advantages in insurance vertical scenarios but exhibits shortcomings in business adaptation and compliance. The evaluation also accurately identifies the common bottlenecks of current large models in professional scenarios such as insurance actuarial, underwriting and claim settlement reasoning, and compliant marketing copywriting. The establishment of CUFEInse not only fills the gap in professional evaluation benchmarks for the insurance field, providing academia and industry with a professional, systematic, and authoritative evaluation tool, but also its construction concept and methodology offer important references for the evaluation paradigm of large models in vertical fields, serving as an authoritative reference for academic model optimization and industrial model selection.

Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets. These results are further supported by evaluation using GPT-4o. Through our approach, we may gain insights into the inherent interpretability of the decision-making process of the model."}

A promising approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLM agents is to better utilize prior experiences in guiding current decisions. However, LLMs acquire experience either through implicit memory via training, which suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited interpretability, or explicit memory via prompting, which lacks adaptability. In this paper, we introduce a novel agent-centric, trainable, multi-layered graph memory framework and evaluate how context memory enhances the ability of LLMs to utilize parametric information. The graph abstracts raw agent trajectories into structured decision paths in a state machine and further distills them into high-level, human-interpretable strategic meta-cognition. In order to make memory adaptable, we propose a reinforcement-based weight optimization procedure that estimates the empirical utility of each meta-cognition based on reward feedback from downstream tasks. These optimized strategies are then dynamically integrated into the LLM agent's training loop through meta-cognitive prompting. Empirically, the learnable graph memory delivers robust generalization, improves LLM agents' strategic reasoning performance, and provides consistent benefits during Reinforcement Learning (RL) training."}

Specifically, this paper first conducts a comprehensive analysis of the impact of random noise on the model's generation. We found that noise not only contains rich semantic information, but also allows for the erasure of unwanted semantics from it in an extremely simple way based on information theory, and using the equivalence between the generation process of diffusion model and semantic injection to inject semantics into the cleaned noise. Then, we mathematically decipher these observations and propose a simple but efficient training-free and universal two-step \"Semantic Erasure-Injection\" process to modulate the initial noise in T2C diffusion model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is consistently effective across various T2C models based on both DiT and UNet architectures and presents a novel perspective for optimizing the generation of diffusion model, providing a universal tool for consistent generation."}

DANS-KGC comprises three key components: the Difficulty Assessment Module (DAM), the Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (ANS), and the Dynamic Training Mechanism (DTM). DAM evaluates the learning difficulty of entities by integrating semantic and structural features. Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples.

We introduce AlignSurvey, the first benchmark that systematically replicates and evaluates the full social survey pipeline using LLMs. It defines four tasks aligned with key survey stages: social role modeling, semi-structured interview modeling, attitude stance modeling and survey response modeling. It also provides task-specific evaluation metrics to assess alignment fidelity, consistency, and fairness at both individual and group levels, with a focus on demographic diversity. To support AlignSurvey, we construct a multi-tiered dataset architecture: (i) the Social Foundation Corpus, a cross-national resource with 44K+ interview dialogues and 400K+ structured survey records; and (ii) a suite of Entire-Pipeline Survey Datasets, including the expert-annotated AlignSurvey-Expert (ASE) and two nationally representative surveys for cross-cultural evaluation.

Moreover, existing CMH approaches typically overlook the partial semantic overlaps inherent in multi-label data, limiting their robustness and generalization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing (SCBCH). The framework comprises two complementary modules: (1) Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC), which leverages cross-modal semantic consistency to estimate sample reliability and reduce the impact of noisy labels; (2) Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH), which dynamically generates soft contrastive sample pairs based on multi-label semantic overlap, enabling adaptive contrastive learning between semantically similar and dissimilar samples across modalities.

In the training stage, to tackle feature entanglement that impedes cross-domain generalization and rapid adaptation, we propose the Adversarial-Contrastive Feature Decomposition (ACFD) module.

Additionally, their inflexible reasoning workflows cannot adapt to different tasks and knowledge graphs. To enhance LLMs' logic consistency in structured knowledge reasoning, we specifically target the logits output from the autoregressive generation process. We propose the \\textit{Logits-to-Logic} framework, which incorporates logits strengthening and logits filtering as core modules to correct logical defects in LLM outputs. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves LLMs' logic consistency in structured knowledge reasoning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple KGQA benchmarks."}

To address this, recent work has applied Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to diffusion models, yielding significant improvements.~However, DPO-like methods exhibit two key limitations: 1) High computational cost,due to the entire model fine-tuning; 2) Sensitivity to reference model quality}, due to its tendency to introduce instability and bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework for human preference alignment in diffusion models (PC-Diffusion), using a lightweight, trainable Preference Classifier that directly models the relative preference between samples. By restricting preference learning to this classifier, PC-Diffusion decouples preference alignment from the generative model, eliminating the need for entire model fine-tuning and reference model reliance.~We further provide theoretical guarantees for PC-Diffusion:1) PC-Diffusion ensures that the preference-guided distributions are consistently propagated across timesteps. 2)The training objective of the preference classifier is equivalent to DPO, but does not require a reference model.3) The proposed preference-guided correction can progressively steer generation toward preference-aligned regions.~Empirical results show that PC-Diffusion achieves comparable preference consistency to DPO while significantly reducing training costs and enabling efficient and stable preference-guided generation."}

This dependency not only limits scalability and generalization but also restricts adaptability to diverse application scenarios. In this paper, a general-purpose foundation model for SAR land-cover classification is developed, serving as a robust cornerstone to accelerate the development and deployment of various downstream models. Specifically, a Dynamic Instance and Contour Consistency Contrastive Learning (DI3CL) pre-training framework is presented, which incorporates a Dynamic Instance (DI) module and a Contour Consistency (CC) module. DI module enhances global contextual awareness by enforcing local consistency across different views of the same region. CC module leverages shallow feature maps to guide the model to focus on the geometric contours of SAR land-cover objects, thereby improving structural discrimination. Additionally, to enhance robustness and generalization during pre-training, a large-scale and diverse dataset named SARSense, comprising 460,532 SAR images, is constructed to enable the model to capture comprehensive and representative features. To evaluate the generalization capability of our foundation model, we conducted extensive experiments across a variety of SAR land-cover classification tasks, including SAR land-cover mapping, water body detection, and road extraction. The results consistently demonstrate that the proposed DI3CL outperforms existing methods. Our code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at: https://github.com/SARpre-train/DI3CL."}

Extended version with full Appendix", "summary": "Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

Among these, theta-band synchrony has been closely associated with language processing, attentional control, and inner speech. However, previous studies have largely focused on a single mode, such as overt speech, and have rarely conducted an integrated comparison of theta synchrony across different speech modes. In this study, we analyzed differences in theta-band neural synchrony across speech modes based on connectivity metrics, focusing on region-wise variations. The results revealed that overt and whispered speech exhibited broader and stronger frontotemporal synchrony, reflecting active motor-phonological coupling during overt articulation, whereas perceived speech showed dominant posterior and temporal synchrony patterns, consistent with auditory perception and comprehension processes. In contrast, imagined speech demonstrated a more spatially confined but internally coherent synchronization pattern, primarily involving frontal and supplementary motor regions. These findings indicate that the extent and spatial distribution of theta synchrony differ substantially across modes, with overt articulation engaging widespread cortical interactions, whispered speech showing intermediate engagement, and perception relying predominantly on temporoparietal networks. Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the differences in theta-band neural synchrony across various speech modes, thereby uncovering both the shared and distinct neural dynamics underlying language perception and imagined speech."}

However, a key challenge arises from the inherent mismatch between the discrete token outputs of MLLMs and the continuous nature of quality scores required by IQA tasks. This discrepancy significantly hinders the performance of MLLM-based IQA methods. Previous approaches that convert discrete token predictions into continuous scores often suffer from conversion errors. Moreover, the semantic confusion introduced by level tokens (e.g., ``good'') further constrains the performance of MLLMs on IQA tasks and degrades their original capabilities for related tasks. To tackle these problems, we provide a theoretical analysis of the errors inherent in previous approaches and, motivated by this analysis, propose a simple yet effective framework, Q-Scorer. This framework incorporates a lightweight regression module and IQA-specific score tokens into the MLLM pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Scorer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple IQA benchmarks, generalizes well to mixed datasets, and further improves when combined with other methods."}

A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms strong baselines in generation quality, diversity, and efficiency."}

Nevertheless, tasks derived from work-related contexts inherently reflect real-world complexities, characterized by long-tailed distributions, extreme multi-label target spaces, and scarce data availability. The rise of generalist embedding models prompts the question of their performance in the work domain, especially as progress in the field has focused mainly on individual tasks. To this end, we introduce WorkBench, the first unified evaluation suite spanning six work-related tasks formulated explicitly as ranking problems, establishing a common ground for multi-task progress. Based on this benchmark, we find significant positive cross-task transfer, and use this insight to compose task-specific bipartite graphs from real-world data, synthetically enriched through grounding. This leads to Unified Work Embeddings (UWE), a task-agnostic bi-encoder that exploits our training-data structure with a many-to-many InfoNCE objective, and leverages token-level embeddings with task-agnostic soft late interaction. UWE demonstrates zero-shot ranking performance on unseen target spaces in the work domain, enables low-latency inference by caching the task target space embeddings, and shows significant gains in macro-averaged MAP and RP@10 over generalist embedding models."}

Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical plane-enhanced scene graph that supports open vocabulary and adopts dominant planar structures as spatial anchors, which enables clearer reasoning chains and more reliable high-level inferences. Furthermore, we design a task-adaptive subgraph extraction method to filter query-irrelevant information dynamically, reducing contextual noise and improving 3D scene reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions. These findings suggest that our VARS will likely emerge as an invaluable tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment."}

To tackle this challenge, we propose NOTAM-Evolve, a self-evolving framework that enables a large language model (LLM) to autonomously master complex NOTAM interpretation. Leveraging a knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval module for data grounding, the framework introduces a closed-loop learning process where the LLM progressively improves from its own outputs, minimizing the need for extensive human-annotated reasoning traces. In conjunction with this framework, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs. Our experiments demonstrate that NOTAM-Evolve achieves a 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over the base LLM, establishing a new state of the art on the task of structured NOTAM interpretation."}

We demonstrate that CDI$^s$ integration reliably enhances or preserves segmentation performance in 94% of evaluated configurations, with individual architectures achieving up to 72.5% statistically significant relative improvement over baseline modalities. CDI$^s$ + DWI emerges as the safest enhancement pathway, achieving significant improvements in half of evaluated architectures with zero instances of degradation.

Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples.

Our results show that LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT-like models. Moreover, when used in a zero-shot setup, LLMs perform comparably in South Slavic languages and English.

To improve the structured data QA ability of small-scale LLMs, we propose a self-correction distillation (SCD) method.

Experiments across 5 benchmarks with 3 structured data types demonstrate that our SCD achieves the best performance and superior generalization on small-scale LLM (8B) compared to other distillation methods, and closely approaches the performance of GPT4 on some datasets.

ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments)."}

Existing methods either use one shared parameterized module across all roles or assign a separate parameterized module to each role. However, the role-shared module may ignore distinct traits of each role, weakening personality learning, while the role-specific module may overlook shared traits across multiple roles, hindering commonality modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel HyCoRA: Hyper-Contrastive Role-Adaptive learning framework, which efficiently improves multi-character role-playing ability by balancing the learning of distinct and shared traits. Specifically, we propose a Hyper-Half Low-Rank Adaptation structure, where one half is a role-specific module generated by a lightweight hyper-network, and the other half is a trainable role-shared module. The role-specific module is devised to represent distinct persona signatures, while the role-shared module serves to capture common traits. Moreover, to better reflect distinct personalities across different roles, we design a hyper-contrastive learning mechanism to help the hyper-network distinguish their unique characteristics. Extensive experimental results on both English and Chinese available benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Further GPT-4 evaluations and visual analyses also verify the capability of HyCoRA to capture role characteristics."}

These constraints cause a lack of geometric cues and reduced accuracy in occluded or truncated scenes. While recent approaches incorporate additional depth information to address geometric ambiguity, they overlook the visual cues crucial for robust recognition. We propose MonoCLUE, which enhances monocular 3D detection by leveraging both local clustering and generalized scene memory of visual features. First, we perform K-means clustering on visual features to capture distinct object-level appearance parts (e.g., bonnet, car roof), improving detection of partially visible objects. The clustered features are propagated across regions to capture objects with similar appearances. Second, we construct a generalized scene memory by aggregating clustered features across images, providing consistent representations that generalize across scenes. This improves object-level feature consistency, enabling stable detection across varying environments. Lastly, we integrate both local cluster features and generalized scene memory into object queries, guiding attention toward informative regions. Exploiting a unified local clustering and generalized scene memory strategy, MonoCLUE enables robust monocular 3D detection under occlusion and limited visibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark."}

BARD10 is a curated corpus of Bangla blog and opinion prose from ten contemporary authors, alongside the methodical assessment of four representative classifiers: SVM (Support Vector Machine), Bangla BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), XGBoost, and a MLP (Multilayer Perception), utilizing uniform preprocessing on both BARD10 and the benchmark corpora BAAD16 (Bangla Authorship Attribution Dataset of 16 authors). In all datasets, the classical TF-IDF + SVM baseline outperformed, attaining a macro-F1 score of 0.997 on BAAD16 and 0.921 on BARD10, while Bangla BERT lagged by as much as five points. This study reveals that BARD10 authors are highly sensitive to stop-word pruning, while BAAD16 authors remain comparatively robust highlighting genre-dependent reliance on stop-word signatures. Error analysis revealed that high frequency components transmit authorial signatures that are diminished or reduced by transformer models. Three insights are identified: Bangla stop-words serve as essential stylistic indicators; finely calibrated ML models prove effective within short-text limitations; and BARD10 connects formal literature with contemporary web dialogue, offering a reproducible benchmark for future long-context or domain-adapted transformers."}

However, these models are often restricted by a ``single-task-single-model'' paradigm, severely limiting their generalizability and scalability in multi-task scenarios. Motivated by the cross-domain generalization ability of large language models, we propose a universal visual perception framework based on flow matching that can generate diverse visual representations across multiple tasks. Our approach formulates the process as a universal flow-matching problem from image patch tokens to task-specific representations rather than an independent generation or regression problem. By leveraging a strong self-supervised foundation model as the anchor and introducing a multi-scale, circular task embedding mechanism, our method learns a universal velocity field to bridge the gap between heterogeneous tasks, supporting efficient and flexible representation transfer. Extensive experiments on classification, detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and image-text retrieval demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, outperforming prior generalist and several specialist models. Ablation studies further validate the robustness, scalability, and generalization of our framework. Our work marks a significant step towards general-purpose visual perception, providing a solid foundation for future research in universal vision modeling."}

While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as \"Misusing allValuesFrom\". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates superior performance over baselines, showing 26% higher precision and 28.2% higher recall than GPT-4.1 in generating CQs for pitfall validation. This research enables automatic generation of TBox-validating CQs using LLMs, significantly reducing manual effort while improving semantic alignment between ontologies and expert knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to target semantic pitfall validation in CQ generation using LLMs."}

Drawing on corpora of science fiction (Gollancz SF Masterworks) and general fiction (NovelTM), we operationalise Darko Suvin's theory of estrangement as computationally measurable deviation in token prediction, using RoBERTa to generate lexical substitutes for masked referents and classifying them via Gemini. We quantify conceptual slippage through three metrics: retention rate, replacement rate, and entropy, mapping the stability or disruption of category boundaries across genres. Our findings reveal that science fiction exhibits heightened conceptual permeability, particularly around machine referents, which show significant cross-category substitution and dispersion. Human terms, by contrast, maintain semantic coherence and often anchor substitutional hierarchies. These patterns suggest a genre-specific restructuring within anthropocentric logics. We argue that estrangement in science fiction operates as a controlled perturbation of semantic norms, detectable through probabilistic modelling, and that MLMs, when used critically, serve as interpretive instruments capable of surfacing genre-conditioned ontological assumptions. This study contributes to the methodological repertoire of computational literary studies and offers new insights into the linguistic infrastructure of science fiction."}

Recent studies control sketch features at stroke-level by editing values of stroke embeddings as conditions. However, in order to provide generator a global view about what a sketch is going to be drawn, all these edited conditions should be collected and fed into generator simultaneously before generation starts, i.e., no further manipulation is allowed during sketch generating process. In order to realize sketch drawing manipulation more flexibly, we propose a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generating process. Instead of generating an entire sketch at once, each stroke in a sketch is generated in a three-staged hierarchy: 1) predicting a stroke embedding to represent which stroke is going to be drawn, and 2) anchoring the predicted stroke on the canvas, and 3) translating the embedding to a sequence of drawing actions to form the full sketch. Moreover, the stroke prediction, anchoring and translation are proceeded auto-regressively, i.e., both the recently generated strokes and their positions are considered to predict the current one, guiding model to produce an appropriate stroke at a suitable position to benefit the full sketch generation. It is flexible to manipulate stroke-level sketch drawing at any time during generation by adjusting the exposed editable stroke embeddings."}

How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks."}

As neural networks acquire increasingly complex skills during their pretraining, it is not clear how successfully they can compose them. In this paper, we focus on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), and study their ability to compose skills across modalities. To this end, we design three evaluation tasks which can be solved sequentially composing two modality-dependent skills, and evaluate several open MLLMs under two main settings: i) prompting the model to directly solve the task, and ii) using a two-step cascaded inference approach, which manually enforces the composition of the two skills for a given task. Even with these straightforward compositions, we find that all evaluated MLLMs exhibit a significant cross-modality skill composition gap. To mitigate the aforementioned gap, we explore two alternatives: i) use chain-of-thought prompting to explicitly instruct MLLMs for skill composition and ii) a specific fine-tuning recipe to promote skill composition. Although those strategies improve model performance, they still exhibit significant skill composition gaps, suggesting that more research is needed to improve cross-modal skill composition in MLLMs."}

To analyze any image, it has to be converted to a simple binary image. This binarization process requires the knowledge of polarity of text in the images. Text polarity is defined as the contrast of text with respect to background. That means, text is darker than the background (dark text on bright background) or vice-versa. The binarization process uses this polarity information to convert the original colour or gray scale image into a binary image. In the literature, there is an intuitive approach based on power-law transformation on the original images. In this approach, the authors have illustrated an interesting phenomenon from the histogram statistics of the transformed images. Considering text and background as two classes, they have observed that maximum between-class variance between two classes is increasing (decreasing) for dark (bright) text on bright (dark) background. The corresponding empirical results have been presented. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of the above phenomenon."}

However, given that quantification interfaces with the logic, pragmatic, and numerical domains, the exact reasons for the poor performance are still unclear. This papers looks at three key features of human quantification shared cross-linguistically that have remained so far unexplored in the (M)LLM literature: the ordering of quantifiers into scales, the ranges of use and prototypicality, and the biases inherent in the human approximate number system. The aim is to determine how these features are encoded in the models' architecture, how they may differ from humans, and whether the results are affected by the type of model and language under investigation. We find that there are clear differences between humans and MLLMs with respect to these features across various tasks that tap into the representation of quantification in vivo vs. in silico. This work, thus, paves the way for addressing the nature of MLLMs as semantic and pragmatic agents, while the cross-linguistic lens can elucidate whether their abilities are robust and stable across different languages."}

In this paper, we aim to use these two types of information jointly and propose a method that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) semantic reasoning with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) structural modeling for MVMLFS. Specifically, the method consists of three main components. (1) LLM is first used as an evaluation agent to assess the latent semantic relevance among feature, view, and label descriptions. (2) A semantic-aware heterogeneous graph with two levels is designed to represent relations among features, views and labels: one is a semantic graph representing semantic relations, and the other is a statistical graph. (3) A lightweight Graph Attention Network (GAT) is applied to learn node embedding in the heterogeneous graph as feature saliency scores for ranking and selection. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines, and it is still effective when applied to small-scale datasets, showcasing its robustness, flexibility, and generalization ability."}

To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning. In general, our work reveals the shortcomings and limitations of current LLMs in their reasoning capabilities, which is of great significance for the further development of LLMs."}

This hypothesis posits a trade-off between the two: a more morphologically complex language can have a more flexible word order, and vice-versa. Positional encodings are a direct target to investigate the implications of this hypothesis in relation to language modelling. We pretrain monolingual model variants with absolute, relative, and no positional encodings for seven typologically diverse languages and evaluate them on four downstream tasks.

The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies for reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning."}

However, recent research reveals that LLMs still exhibit performance gaps in Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) as requiring fine-grained comprehension. The commonly adopted \"extract entities then predict relations\" paradigm in LLM-based methods leads to these gaps due to two main reasons: (1) Numerous unrelated entity pairs introduce noise and interfere with the relation prediction for truly related entity pairs. (2) Although LLMs have identified semantic associations between entities, relation labels beyond the predefined set are still treated as prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Relation as a Prior (RelPrior) paradigm for LLM-based DocRE. For challenge (1), RelPrior utilizes binary relation as a prior to extract and determine whether two entities are correlated, thereby filtering out irrelevant entity pairs and reducing prediction noise. For challenge (2), RelPrior utilizes predefined relation as a prior to match entities for triples extraction instead of directly predicting relation. Thus, it avoids misjudgment caused by strict predefined relation labeling. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that RelPrior achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing LLM-based methods."}

Federated learning (FL), as a decentralized learning framework that trains a shared model with multiple hospitals (a.k.a., FL clients), provides a feasible solution. However, data heterogeneity and resource costs hinder the deployment of FL models, especially when using vision language models (VLM). To address these challenges, we propose a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) based FL approach for medical image classification (FedMedCLIP). Specifically, we introduce a masked feature adaptation module (FAM) as a communication module to reduce the communication load while freezing the CLIP encoders to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, we propose a masked multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a private local classifier to adapt to the client tasks. Moreover, we design an adaptive Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based distillation regularization method to enable mutual learning between FAM and MLP. Finally, we incorporate model compression to transmit the FAM parameters while using ensemble predictions for classification. Extensive experiments on four publicly available medical datasets demonstrate that our model provides feasible performance (e.g., 8\\% higher compared to second best baseline on ISIC2019) with reasonable resource cost (e.g., 120$\\times$ faster than FedAVG)."}

But does this assumption hold for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Sanskrit? We address this question by comparing instruction-tuned and in-context-prompted LLMs with smaller task-specific encoder-decoder models on the Sanskrit poetry-to-prose conversion task. This task is intrinsically challenging: Sanskrit verse exhibits free word order combined with rigid metrical constraints, and its conversion to canonical prose (anvaya) requires multi-step reasoning involving compound segmentation, dependency resolution, and syntactic linearisation. This makes it an ideal testbed to evaluate whether LLMs can surpass specialised models. For LLMs, we apply instruction fine-tuning on general-purpose models and design in-context learning templates grounded in Paninian grammar and classical commentary heuristics. For task-specific modelling, we fully fine-tune a ByT5-Sanskrit Seq2Seq model. Our experiments show that domain-specific fine-tuning of ByT5-Sanskrit significantly outperforms all instruction-driven LLM approaches. Human evaluation strongly corroborates this result, with scores exhibiting high correlation with Kendall's Tau scores. Additionally, our prompting strategies provide an alternative to fine-tuning when domain-specific verse corpora are unavailable, and the task-specific Seq2Seq model demonstrates robust generalisation on out-of-domain evaluations."}

As a representative task for addressing this challenge, layout-to-image generation aims to generate images that are spatially consistent with the given layout condition. Existing layout-to-image methods typically introduce the layout condition by integrating adapter modules into the base generative model. However, the generated images often exhibit low visual quality and stylistic inconsistency with the base model, indicating a loss of pretrained knowledge. To alleviate this issue, we construct the Layout Synthesis (LaySyn) dataset, which leverages images synthesized by the base model itself to mitigate the distribution shift from the pretraining data. Moreover, we propose the Layout Control (Laytrol) Network, in which parameters are inherited from MM-DiT to preserve the pretrained knowledge of the base model. To effectively activate the copied parameters and avoid disturbance from unstable control conditions, we adopt a dedicated initialization scheme for Laytrol. In this scheme, the layout encoder is initialized as a pure text encoder to ensure that its output tokens remain within the data domain of MM-DiT. Meanwhile, the outputs of the layout control network are initialized to zero. In addition, we apply Object-level Rotary Position Embedding to the layout tokens to provide coarse positional information. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."}

Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses elucidate the advantages and limitations of various cognitive pathways across varying problem difficulties and bug types. Our findings also corroborate the alignment of the proposed Scaffold Reasoning framework with human cognitive processes."}

Most CD models assume co-registered inputs, yet real-world imagery often exhibits parallax, viewpoint shifts, and long temporal gaps that cause severe misalignment. Traditional two stage methods that first register and then detect, as well as recent joint frameworks (e.g., BiFA, ChangeRD), still struggle under large displacements, relying on regression only flow, global homographies, or synthetic perturbations. We present DiffRegCD, an integrated framework that unifies dense registration and change detection in a single model. DiffRegCD reformulates correspondence estimation as a Gaussian smoothed classification task, achieving sub-pixel accuracy and stable training. It leverages frozen multi-scale features from a pretrained denoising diffusion model, ensuring robustness to illumination and viewpoint variation. Supervision is provided through controlled affine perturbations applied to standard CD datasets, yielding paired ground truth for both flow and change detection without pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on aerial (LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) and ground level (VL-CMU-CD) datasets show that DiffRegCD consistently surpasses recent baselines and remains reliable under wide temporal and geometric variation, establishing diffusion features and classification based correspondence as a strong foundation for unified change detection."}

Existing methods generally suffer from limited scalability, weak semantic preservation, and high costs. Therefore, we propose MSCR, an automated adversarial attack method based on multi-source candidate replacement. By combining three information sources including cosine similarity in the embedding space of LLMs, the WordNet dictionary, and contextual predictions from a masked language model, we generate for each word in the input question a set of semantically similar candidates, which are then filtered and substituted one by one to carry out the attack. We conduct large-scale experiments on LLMs using the GSM8K and MATH500 benchmarks. The results show that even a slight perturbation involving only a single word can significantly reduce the accuracy of all models, with the maximum drop reaching 49.89% on GSM8K and 35.40% on MATH500, while preserving the high semantic consistency of the perturbed questions. Further analysis reveals that perturbations not only lead to incorrect outputs but also substantially increase the average response length, which results in more redundant reasoning paths and higher computational resource consumption. These findings highlight the robustness deficiencies and efficiency bottlenecks of current LLMs in mathematical reasoning tasks."}

They learn and store personalized features from reference videos of each target individual to generate realistic speaking videos. To ensure models can capture sufficient 3D information and successfully learns the lip-audio mapping, previous studies usually require meticulous processing and fitting several minutes of reference video, which always takes hours. The computational burden of processing and fitting long reference videos severely limits the practical application value of these methods.However, is it really necessary to fit such minutes of reference video? Our exploratory case studies show that using some informative reference video segments of just a few seconds can achieve performance comparable to or even better than the full reference video. This indicates that video informative quality is much more important than its length. Inspired by this observation, we propose the ISExplore (short for Informative Segment Explore), a simple-yet-effective segment selection strategy that automatically identifies the informative 5-second reference video segment based on three key data quality dimensions: audio feature diversity, lip movement amplitude, and number of camera views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach increases data processing and training speed by more than 5x for NeRF and 3DGS methods, while maintaining high-fidelity output.

The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture."}

This article presents an embedding-based benchmarking framework to detect bias in LLMs in the context of formative feedback. Using 600 authentic student essays from the AES 2.0 corpus, we constructed controlled counterfactuals along two dimensions: (i) implicit cues via lexicon-based swaps of gendered terms within essays, and (ii) explicit cues via gendered author background in the prompt. We investigated six representative LLMs (i.e. GPT-5 mini, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3-8B). We first quantified the response divergence with cosine and Euclidean distances over sentence embeddings, then assessed significance via permutation tests, and finally, visualised structure using dimensionality reduction. In all models, implicit manipulations reliably induced larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than for female-male. Only the GPT and Llama models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues. These findings show that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit asymmetric semantic responses to gender substitutions, suggesting persistent gender biases in feedback they provide learners. Qualitative analyses further revealed consistent linguistic differences (e.g., more autonomy-supportive feedback under male cues vs. more controlling feedback under female cues). We discuss implications for fairness auditing of pedagogical GenAI, propose reporting standards for counterfactual evaluation in learning analytics, and outline practical guidance for prompt design and deployment to safeguard equitable feedback."}

A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes. Concurrently, the vision branch learns instance-level prototypes to mitigate the model's reliance on redundant data. For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space.

First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series.

While Transformer-based methods have successfully addressed some limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as their local processing nature and information loss resulting from convolution and downsampling operations, they still face the scalability issue due to the quadratic increase in memory and computational requirements with the length of the input sequence. To overcome this, we propose a pure Mamba-based person ReID framework named ReIDMamba. Specifically, we have designed a Mamba-based strong baseline that effectively leverages fine-grained, discriminative global features by introducing multiple class tokens. To further enhance robust features learning within Mamba, we have carefully designed two novel techniques. First, the multi-granularity feature extractor (MGFE) module, designed with a multi-branch architecture and class token fusion, effectively forms multi-granularity features, enhancing both discrimination ability and fine-grained coverage. Second, the ranking-aware triplet regularization (RATR) is introduced to reduce redundancy in features from multiple branches, enhancing the diversity of multi-granularity features by incorporating both intra-class and inter-class diversity constraints, thus ensuring the robustness of person features. To our knowledge, this is the pioneering work that integrates a purely Mamba-driven approach into ReID research. Our proposed ReIDMamba model boasts only one-third the parameters of TransReID, along with lower GPU memory usage and faster inference throughput.

Specifically, a task-driven prompt generation network is developed with heterogeneous knowledge distillation, to learn the priors of the downstream task. Then, the task-aware quality assessment network is introduced to assess the burst image quality based on the task prompt. Extensive experiments across 10 downstream scenarios demonstrate the impressive BuIQA performance of the proposed approach, outperforming the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, it can achieve $0.33$ dB PSNR improvement in the downstream tasks of denoising and super-resolution, by applying our approach to select the high-quality burst frames."}

Unlike general text generation, parliamentary speeches require not only linguistic quality but also political authenticity and ideological consistency. Current language models lack specialized training for parliamentary contexts, and existing evaluation methods focus on standard NLP metrics rather than political authenticity. To address this, we present ParliaBench, a benchmark for parliamentary speech generation. We constructed a dataset of speeches from UK Parliament to enable systematic model training. We introduce an evaluation framework combining computational metrics with LLM-as-a-judge assessments for measuring generation quality across three dimensions: linguistic quality, semantic coherence, and political authenticity. We propose two novel embedding-based metrics, Political Spectrum Alignment and Party Alignment, to quantify ideological positioning. We fine-tuned five large language models (LLMs), generated 28k speeches, and evaluated them using our framework, comparing baseline and fine-tuned models. Results show that fine-tuning produces statistically significant improvements across the majority of metrics and our novel metrics demonstrate strong discriminative power for political dimensions."}

Although it is quite popular to collect point clouds and images simultaneously, little attention has been paid to the usefulness of image data in 3D UDA when training the models. In this paper, we propose an approach named MMAssist that improves the performance of 3D UDA with multi-modal assistance. A method is designed to align 3D features between the source domain and the target domain by using image and text features as bridges. More specifically, we project the ground truth labels or pseudo labels to the images to get a set of 2D bounding boxes. For each 2D box, we extract its image feature from a pre-trained vision backbone. A large vision-language model (LVLM) is adopted to extract the box's text description, and a pre-trained text encoder is used to obtain its text feature. During the training of the model in the source domain and the student model in the target domain, we align the 3D features of the predicted boxes with their corresponding image and text features, and the 3D features and the aligned features are fused with learned weights for the final prediction. The features between the student branch and the teacher branch in the target domain are aligned as well. To enhance the pseudo labels, we use an off-the-shelf 2D object detector to generate 2D bounding boxes from images and estimate their corresponding 3D boxes with the aid of point cloud, and these 3D boxes are combined with the pseudo labels generated by the teacher model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in three domain adaptation tasks on three popular 3D object detection datasets.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data.

Existing joint registration-detection frameworks typically require retraining and transfer poorly across domains. We introduce a modular pipeline that improves spatial and temporal robustness without altering existing change detection networks. The framework integrates diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and residual flow refinement. A diffusion module synthesizes intermediate morphing frames that bridge large appearance gaps, enabling RoMa to estimate stepwise correspondences between consecutive frames. The composed flow is then refined through a lightweight U-Net to produce a high-fidelity warp that co-registers the original image pair. Extensive experiments on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and DSIFN-CD show consistent gains in both registration accuracy and downstream change detection across multiple backbones, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making. SpeechCARE achieved AUC = 0.88 and F1 = 0.72 for classifying cognitively healthy, MCI, and AD individuals, with AUC = 0.90 and F1 = 0.62 for MCI detection. Bias analysis showed minimal disparities, except for adults over 80. Mitigation techniques included oversampling and weighted loss.

However, they can fall short, especially when required to account for personalization or specific knowledge. In real-life settings, it is impractical to rely on users to detect these errors and request a new response. One way to address this problem is to refine the response before returning it to the user. While existing approaches focus on refining responses within a single LLM, this method struggles to consider diverse aspects needed for effective conversations. In this work, we propose refining responses through a multi-agent framework, where each agent is assigned a specific role for each aspect. We focus on three key aspects crucial to conversational quality: factuality, personalization, and coherence. Each agent is responsible for reviewing and refining one of these aspects, and their feedback is then merged to improve the overall response. To enhance collaboration among them, we introduce a dynamic communication strategy. Instead of following a fixed sequence of agents, our approach adaptively selects and coordinates the most relevant agents based on the specific requirements of each query. We validate our framework on challenging conversational datasets, demonstrating that ours significantly outperforms relevant baselines, particularly in tasks involving knowledge or user's persona, or both."}

Previous work for LLM agents typically relies on elaborate prompt engineering or fine-tuning with expert trajectories to improve performance. In this work, we take a different perspective: we explore constructing process reward models (PRMs) to evaluate each decision and guide the agent's decision-making process. Unlike LLM reasoning, where each step is scored based on correctness, actions in agent tasks do not have a clear-cut correctness. Instead, they should be evaluated based on their proximity to the goal and the progress they have made. Building on this insight, we propose a re-defined PRM for agent tasks, named AgentPRM, to capture both the interdependence between sequential decisions and their contribution to the final goal. This enables better progress tracking and exploration-exploitation balance. To scalably obtain labeled data for training AgentPRM, we employ a Temporal Difference-based (TD-based) estimation method combined with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), which proves more sample-efficient than prior methods. Extensive experiments across different agentic tasks show that AgentPRM is over $8\\times$ more compute-efficient than baselines, and it demonstrates robust improvement when scaling up test-time compute. Moreover, we perform detailed analyses to show how our method works and offer more insights, e.g., applying AgentPRM to the reinforcement learning of LLM agents."}

Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) provide feedback after generating the final answers but fail to evaluate the process for multi-step reasoning. Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) evaluate the reasoning process but require costly human annotations or rollout generation. While implicit PRM is trained only with outcome signals and derives step rewards through reward parameterization without explicit annotations, it is more suitable for multi-step reasoning in MHQA tasks. However, existing implicit PRM has only been explored for plain text scenarios. When adapting to MHQA tasks, it cannot handle the graph structure constraints in KGs and capture the potential inconsistency between CoT and KG paths. To address these limitations, we propose the DPRM (Dual Implicit Process Reward Model). It trains two implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks. Both PRMs, namely KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization without additional explicit annotations. Among them, KG-PRM uses preference pairs to learn structural constraints from KGs. DPRM further introduces a consistency constraint between CoT and KG reasoning steps, making the two PRMs mutually verify and collaboratively optimize the reasoning paths. We also provide a theoretical demonstration of the derivation of process rewards.

To address this problem, we propose SharpV, a minimalist and efficient method for adaptive pruning of visual tokens and KV cache. Different from most uniform compression approaches, SharpV dynamically adjusts pruning ratios based on spatial-temporal information. Remarkably, this adaptive mechanism occasionally achieves performance gains over dense models, offering a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning. During the KV cache pruning stage, based on observations of visual information degradation, SharpV prunes degraded visual features via a self-calibration manner, guided by similarity to original visual features. In this way, SharpV achieves hierarchical cache pruning from the perspective of information bottleneck, offering a new insight into VideoLLMs' information flow. Experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SharpV. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, SharpV is notably the first two-stage pruning framework that operates without requiring access to exposed attention scores, ensuring full compatibility with hardware acceleration techniques like Flash Attention."}

These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice."}

Visual 3D detection based on RGB cameras provides a cost-effective solution compared to the LiDAR paradigm. While achieving promising detection accuracy, current deep neural network-based models remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples. The underlying safety concerns motivate us to investigate realistic adversarial attacks in AD scenarios. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of placing adversarial posters on the road surface to induce hallucinations in the detector. However, the unnatural appearance of the posters makes them easily noticeable by humans, and their fixed content can be readily targeted and defended. To address these limitations, we propose the AdvRoad to generate diverse road-style adversarial posters. The adversaries have naturalistic appearances resembling the road surface while compromising the detector to perceive non-existent objects at the attack locations. We employ a two-stage approach, termed Road-Style Adversary Generation and Scenario-Associated Adaptation, to maximize the attack effectiveness on the input scene while ensuring the natural appearance of the poster, allowing the attack to be carried out stealthily without drawing human attention. Extensive experiments show that AdvRoad generalizes well to different detectors, scenes, and spoofing locations. Moreover, physical attacks further demonstrate the practical threats in real-world environments."}

Our central finding is that a reward model trained only on these structural signals achieves a pairwise accuracy (68.20%) comparable to a powerful LLM baseline that analyzes the full transcript (70.04%). Furthermore, a hybrid model combining interaction dynamics with textual analysis achieves the highest performance (80.17%), demonstrating their complementary nature.

Third, our cascade denoising algorithm dynamically adjusts training weights through progressively increasing IoU thresholds across decoder layers, guiding the model to learn robust boundaries from reliable visual cues rather than overfitting to noisy labels.

In particular, the impact of shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious correlations instead of capturing causal task-relevant features, has received limited attention. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth study to assess how detectors are influenced by potential shortcuts based on textual features, which are most susceptible to manipulation by social bots. We design a series of shortcut scenarios by constructing spurious associations between user labels and superficial textual cues to evaluate model robustness. Results show that shifts in irrelevant feature distributions significantly degrade social bot detector performance, with an average relative accuracy drop of 32\\% in the baseline models. To tackle this challenge, we propose mitigation strategies based on large language models, leveraging counterfactual data augmentation.

To address this, we introduce a multi-modal deepfake detection and localization framework based on a Feature Pyramid-Transformer (FPN-Transformer), addressing critical gaps in cross-modal generalization and temporal boundary regression. The proposed approach utilizes pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) to extract hierarchical temporal features. A multi-scale feature pyramid is constructed through R-TLM blocks with localized attention mechanisms, enabling joint analysis of cross-context temporal dependencies. The dual-branch prediction head simultaneously predicts forgery probabilities and refines temporal offsets of manipulated segments, achieving frame-level localization precision. We evaluate our approach on the test set of the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark, showing a good performance with a final score of 0.7535 for cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments.

In this work, we introduce Bangla-SGP, a novel parallel dataset consisting of 1,000 human-annotated sentence-gloss pairs which was augmented with around 3,000 synthetically generated pairs using syntactic and morphological rules through a rule-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The gloss sequences of the spoken Bangla sentences are made up of individual glosses which are Bangla sign supported words and serve as an intermediate representation for a continuous sign. Our dataset consists of 1000 high quality Bangla sentences that are manually annotated into a gloss sequence by a professional signer. The augmentation process incorporates rule-based linguistic strategies and prompt engineering techniques that we have adopted by critically analyzing our human annotated sentence-gloss pairs and by working closely with our professional signer. Furthermore, we fine-tune several transformer-based models such as mBart50, Google mT5, GPT4.1-nano and evaluate their sentence-to-gloss translation performance using BLEU scores, based on these evaluation metrics we compare the model's gloss-translation consistency across our dataset and the RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T benchmark."}

Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models' long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness. Finally, we propose MoME, a new paradigm in which LLMs monitor other models' misbehavior through their CoT and provide structured judgments along with supporting evidence."}

We find that, for moral robustness, model family accounts for most of the variance, while model size shows no systematic effect. The Claude family is, by a significant margin, the most robust, followed by Gemini and GPT-4 models, with other families exhibiting lower robustness. In contrast, moral susceptibility exhibits a mild family effect but a clear within-family size effect, with larger variants being more susceptible. Moreover, robustness and susceptibility are positively correlated, an association that is more pronounced at the family level.

Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal. Finally, we conclude by analyzing the mechanistic implications of our approach."}

Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively.

In this work, we investigate whether the internal representations used by these models during text-to-image generation contain semantic information that is meaningful to humans. To do so, we perform probing on Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers that predict semantic attributes for objects and evaluate these predictions against human annotations. Surprisingly, we find that this success can actually be attributed to the text encoding occurring in CLIP rather than the reverse diffusion process. We demonstrate that groups of specific semantic attributes have markedly different decoding accuracy than the average, and are thus represented to different degrees. Finally, we show that attributes become more difficult to disambiguate from one another during the inverse diffusion process, further demonstrating the strongest semantic representation of object attributes in CLIP. We conclude that the separately trained CLIP vision-language model is what determines the human-like semantic representation, and that the diffusion process instead takes the role of a visual decoder."}

Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories. This work thereby establishes a unified framework for both evaluating and enforcing faithfulness in multimodal reasoning."}

When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models' privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable).

We introduce Beyond the Pixels, a hierarchical evaluation framework that decomposes identity assessment into feature-level transformations. Our approach guides VLMs through structured reasoning by (1) hierarchically decomposing subjects into (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision tree, and (2) prompting for concrete transformations rather than abstract similarity scores. This decomposition grounds VLM analysis in verifiable visual evidence, reducing hallucinations and improving consistency. We validate our framework across four state-of-the-art generative models, demonstrating strong alignment with human judgments in measuring identity consistency. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark specifically designed to stress-test generative models. It comprises 1,078 image-prompt pairs spanning diverse subject types, including underrepresented categories such as anthropomorphic and animated characters, and captures an average of six to seven transformation axes per prompt."}

Yet current approaches fall short: neural retrievers lack reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide semantic depth but at prohibitive cost, and query rewriting or decomposition limits improvement to static transformations. As a result, existing methods fail to capture the iterative dynamics of exploration, feedback, and revision that complex user queries demand. We introduce Orion, a training framework that enables compact models (350M-1.2B parameters) to perform iterative retrieval through learned search strategies. Orion combines: (1) synthetic trajectory generation and supervised fine-tuning to encourage diverse exploration patterns in models, (2) reinforcement learning (RL) that rewards effective query refinement and backtracking behaviors, and (3) inference-time beam search algorithms that exploit the self-reflection capabilities learned during RL. Despite using only 3% of the training data available, our 1.2B model achieves 77.6% success on SciFact (vs. 72.6% for prior retrievers), 25.2% on BRIGHT (vs. 22.1%), 63.2% on NFCorpus (vs. 57.8%), and remains competitive on FEVER, HotpotQA, and MSMarco. It outperforms retrievers up to 200-400x larger on five of six benchmarks. These findings suggest that retrieval performance can emerge from learned strategies, not just model scale, when models are trained to search, reflect, and revise."}

To develop and evaluate effective morphing attack detection (MAD) systems, we need access to high-quality, realistic morphed images that reflect the challenges posed in real-world scenarios. However, existing morph generation methods often produce images that are blurry, riddled with artifacts, or poorly constructed making them easy to detect and not representative of the most dangerous attacks. In this work, we introduce StableMorph, a novel approach that generates highly realistic, artifact-free morphed face images using modern diffusion-based image synthesis. Unlike prior methods, StableMorph produces full-head images with sharp details, avoids common visual flaws, and offers unmatched control over visual attributes. Through extensive evaluation, we show that StableMorph images not only rival or exceed the quality of genuine face images but also maintain a strong ability to fool face recognition systems posing a greater challenge to existing MAD solutions and setting a new standard for morph quality in research and operational testing. StableMorph improves the evaluation of biometric security by creating more realistic and effective attacks and supports the development of more robust detection systems."}

This \"patch\" introduces only 0.003% additional parameters, yet reliably steers model behavior toward that of a safer reference model. Across three critical domains (toxicity mitigation, bias reduction, and harmfulness refusal) policy patches achieve safety improvements comparable to next-generation safety-aligned models while preserving fluency.

To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \\cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \\textbf{20\\%}.

In this work, we introduce a new dataset focused on a novel and realistic presentation attack instrument called Nylon Face Masks (NFMs), designed to simulate advanced 3D spoofing scenarios. NFMs are particularly concerning due to their elastic structure and photorealistic appearance, which enable them to closely mimic the victim's facial geometry when worn by an attacker. To reflect real-world smartphone-based usage conditions, we collected the dataset using an iPhone 11 Pro, capturing 3,760 bona fide samples from 100 subjects and 51,281 NFM attack samples across four distinct presentation scenarios involving both humans and mannequins. We benchmark the dataset using five state-of-the-art PAD methods to evaluate their robustness under unseen attack conditions. The results demonstrate significant performance variability across methods, highlighting the challenges posed by NFMs and underscoring the importance of developing PAD techniques that generalise effectively to emerging spoofing threats."}

From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships."}

We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity.

In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information.

However, training reliable RMs under limited resources remains challenging due to the reliance on large-scale preference annotations and the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs. To address this, we propose SparseRM, which leverages Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to extract preference-relevant information encoded in model representations, enabling the construction of a lightweight and interpretable reward model. SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into downstream alignment pipelines, highlighting its potential for efficient alignment."}

This work is part of the Zerovision project. Code available at: https://github.com/ertis-research/zerovision", "summary": "Foam formation in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs) is a major challenge that can reduce treatment efficiency and increase costs. The ability to automatically examine changes in real-time with respect to the percentage of foam can be of great benefit to the plant. However, large amounts of labeled data are required to train standard Machine Learning (ML) models. The development of these systems is slow due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data. Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization. This research offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs. The findings highlight the significant potential of integrating large-scale foundational models into FL systems to solve real-world industrial challenges characterized by distributed and sensitive data."}

This paper introduces DeepProofLog (DPrL), a novel NeSy system based on stochastic logic programs, which addresses the scalability limitations of previous methods. DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks, allowing efficient neural guidance over the proving system. Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning.

However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a \"window\" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming.

The framework operates in three stages: (1) transforming video content into fine-grained captions using a vision-language model, (2) constructing structured knowledge by organizing the captions into four semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), and (3) generating slot-wise explanations that reveal which semantic factors contribute most to the anomaly decision. We evaluate TbVAD on two public benchmarks, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence, demonstrating that textual knowledge reasoning provides interpretable and reliable anomaly detection for real-world surveillance scenarios."}

The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture."}

We first introduce the information bottleneck method to learn representations for each modality independently, and then match the source and target domains in the representation space with correlation alignment. To balance the domain alignment of all modalities, we formulate the problem as a multi-objective task, aiming for a Pareto optimal solution. By exploiting the properties specific to our model, the problem can be simplified to a quadratic programming problem.

In this work, we introduce a Non-Aligned Reference (NAR-IQA) framework tailored for NVS, where it is assumed that the reference view shares partial scene content but lacks pixel-level alignment. We constructed a large-scale image dataset containing synthetic distortions targeting Temporal Regions of Interest (TROI) to train our NAR-IQA model. Our model is built on a contrastive learning framework that incorporates LoRA-enhanced DINOv2 embeddings and is guided by supervision from existing IQA methods.

Our model outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA, NR-IQA, and NAR-IQA methods, achieving robust performance on both aligned and non-aligned references.

However, adapting LLMs to effectively handle structural data, such as knowledge graphs or web data, remains a challenging problem. Some approaches adopt complex strategies to convert graphs into text sequences, resulting in significant token overhead and rendering them impractical for large-scale graphs. Others introduce additional modules to encode graphs into fixed-size token representations for LLMs. However, these methods typically require large-scale post-training on graph-text corpus and complex alignment procedures, yet often yield sub-optimal results due to poor modality alignment. Inspired by in-parameter knowledge injection for test-time adaptation of LLMs, we propose GRIP, a novel framework that equips LLMs with the ability to internalize complex relational information from graphs through carefully designed fine-tuning tasks. This knowledge is efficiently stored within lightweight LoRA parameters, enabling the fine-tuned LLM to perform a wide range of graph-related tasks without requiring access to the original graph at inference time.

This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE).

Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI).

Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) offer promising opportunities for building universal models. Yet, task-agnostic FMs often require fine-tuning for downstream applications, whereas task-specific FMs rely on massive amounts of labeled data for training, which is costly and impractical in the remote sensing (RS) domain. To address these challenges, we propose LandSegmenter, an LULC FM framework that resolves three-stage challenges at the input, model, and output levels. From the input side, to alleviate the heavy demand on labeled data for FM training, we introduce LAnd Segment (LAS), a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-source dataset built primarily with globally sampled weak labels from existing LULC products. LAS provides a scalable, cost-effective alternative to manual annotation, enabling large-scale FM training across diverse LULC domains. For model architecture, LandSegmenter integrates an RS-specific adapter for cross-modal feature extraction and a text encoder for semantic awareness enhancement. At the output stage, we introduce a class-wise confidence-guided fusion strategy to mitigate semantic omissions and further improve LandSegmenter's zero-shot performance. We evaluate LandSegmenter on six precisely annotated LULC datasets spanning diverse modalities and class taxonomies. Extensive transfer learning and zero-shot experiments demonstrate that LandSegmenter achieves competitive or superior performance, particularly in zero-shot settings when transferred to unseen datasets.

Then, a cross-granularity feature fusion module strengthens the inherent interactions between region features of varying granularities. This module enhances the discriminability of representations at each granularity level by integrating region representations from adjacent hierarchies, further improving ZSL recognition performance.

Our proposed cross-node attribute regularizer enforces the distances between attribute features to be similar across different nodes. In this manner, the overall attribute feature space would be stable during learning, and thus facilitate the establishment of visual-to-attribute(V2A) relationships. Then, we introduce the global attribute-tovisual consensus to mitigate biased V2A mappings learned from individual nodes.

Despite being introduced over a decade ago, progress in modulo image recovery has been slow, especially in the use of modern deep learning techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that standard HDR methods are unsuitable for modulo recovery.

Still, adapting existing Transformer architectures for modulo recovery demands novel techniques. To this end, we present Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (SSViT), the first deep learning framework for modulo video reconstruction.

Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer to guide the model toward target language contexts and mitigate off-target language generation issue, contributing to addressing challenges in multilingual LLMs. We also introduce a lightweight adaptation that learns a soft head mask to modulate attention outputs over language heads, requiring only 20 tunable parameters to improve XQuAD accuracy. Overall, our work enhances both the interpretability and multilingual capabilities of LLMs from the perspective of MHA."}

Achieving high detection performance requires that the estimated quality closely aligns with the actual localization accuracy. To this end, existing approaches predict the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the predicted and ground-truth (GT) boxes as a proxy for localization quality. However, box-level IoU prediction suffers from a structural coupling issue: since the predicted box is derived from the detector's internal estimation of the GT box, the predicted IoU--based on their similarity--can be overestimated for poorly localized boxes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Pixel-level Quality Assessment (PQA) framework, which replaces box-level IoU prediction with the integration of pixel-level spatial consistency. PQA measures the alignment between each pixel's relative position to the predicted box and its corresponding position to the GT box. By operating at the pixel level, PQA avoids directly comparing the predicted box with the estimated GT box, thereby eliminating the inherent similarity bias in box-level IoU prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a new integration metric that aggregates pixel-level spatial consistency into a unified quality score, yielding a more accurate approximation of the actual localization quality. Extensive experiments on HRSC2016 and DOTA demonstrate that PQA can be seamlessly integrated into various oriented object detectors, consistently improving performance (e.g., +5.96% AP$_{50:95}$ on Rotated RetinaNet and +2.32% on STD)."}

These methods typically improve a target output by intentionally degrading another, often the unconditional output, using heuristic perturbation functions such as identity mixing or blurred conditions. However, these approaches lack a principled foundation and rely on manually designed distortions. In this work, we propose Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance (ASAG), a novel method that reinterprets attention scores in diffusion models through the lens of optimal transport and intentionally disrupt the transport cost via Sinkhorn algorithm. Instead of naively corrupting the attention mechanism, ASAG injects an adversarial cost within self-attention layers to reduce pixel-wise similarity between queries and keys. This deliberate degradation weakens misleading attention alignments and leads to improved conditional and unconditional sample quality. ASAG shows consistent improvements in text-to-image diffusion, and enhances controllability and fidelity in downstream applications such as IP-Adapter and ControlNet. The method is lightweight, plug-and-play, and improves reliability without requiring any model retraining."}

In this context, open-set recognition plays a vital role by identifying whether a sample belongs to one of the known classes seen during training or should be rejected as an unknown. Recent studies have shown that features learned in the later stages of deep neural networks are observed to cluster around their class means, which themselves are arranged as individual vertices of a regular simplex [32].

We probe metric robustness through seven factuality-preserving perturbations applied to summaries, namely paraphrasing, simplification, synonym replacement, logically equivalent negations, vocabulary reduction, compression, and source text insertion, and further analyze their sensitivity to retrieval context and claim information density.

Then, we learn to project the vision features to group related semantics, among which are more likely to have relationships. Finally, we fuse the visual features with the textual by using inheritable cross-attention, where we globally remove the redundant visual relationships by discarding visual-language feature pairs with low correlation.

However, arbitrary rotations introduce variations in point cloud orientations, posing a long-standing challenge for effective representation learning. The core of this issue is the disruption of the point cloud's intrinsic directional characteristics caused by rotational perturbations. Recent methods attempt to implicitly model rotational equivariance and invariance, preserving directional information and propagating it into deep semantic spaces. Yet, they often fall short of fully exploiting the multiscale directional nature of point clouds to enhance feature representations. To address this, we propose the Direction-Perceptive Vector Network (DiPVNet). At its core is an atomic dot-product operator that simultaneously encodes directional selectivity and rotation invariance--endowing the network with both rotational symmetry modeling and adaptive directional perception. At the local level, we introduce a Learnable Local Dot-Product (L2DP) Operator, which enables interactions between a center point and its neighbors to adaptively capture the non-uniform local structures of point clouds. At the global level, we leverage generalized harmonic analysis to prove that the dot-product between point clouds and spherical sampling vectors is equivalent to a direction-aware spherical Fourier transform (DASFT). This leads to the construction of a global directional response spectrum for modeling holistic directional structures. We rigorously prove the rotation invariance of both operators.

Recent studies control sketch features at stroke-level by editing values of stroke embeddings as conditions.

In order to realize sketch drawing manipulation more flexibly, we propose a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generating process. Instead of generating an entire sketch at once, each stroke in a sketch is generated in a three-staged hierarchy: 1) predicting a stroke embedding to represent which stroke is going to be drawn, and 2) anchoring the predicted stroke on the canvas, and 3) translating the embedding to a sequence of drawing actions to form the full sketch. Moreover, the stroke prediction, anchoring and translation are proceeded auto-regressively, i.e., both the recently generated strokes and their positions are considered to predict the current one, guiding model to produce an appropriate stroke at a suitable position to benefit the full sketch generation.

(2) Object-layered Editing module, to establish coordinated intra-layer text guidance and cross-layer geometric mapping, achieving disentangled semantic and structural modifications. (3) Transparency-guided Layer Fusion module, to facilitate structure-coherent inter-object layer fusion through precise transparency guidance learning. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of LayerEdit over existing methods, showing unprecedented intra-object controllability and inter-object coherence in complex multi-object scenarios.

Most CD models assume co-registered inputs, yet real-world imagery often exhibits parallax, viewpoint shifts, and long temporal gaps that cause severe misalignment.

It leverages frozen multi-scale features from a pretrained denoising diffusion model, ensuring robustness to illumination and viewpoint variation.

A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes. Concurrently, the vision branch learns instance-level prototypes to mitigate the model's reliance on redundant data. For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space.

Different from these researches, we delve into the edge secret of both modalities for resilient fusion and propose a novel Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework to unify the multi-modality heterogeneous features with latent edge cues. In this framework, we first propose Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding, which obtains uncertainty indicators while realigning event-RGB features into unified semantic space guided by re-coded distribution, and transfers event-RGB distributions into re-coded features by utilizing a pre-established edge dictionary as clues. We then propose Re-coded Consolidation and Uncertainty Optimization, which utilize re-coded edge features and uncertainty indicators to solve the heterogeneous event-RGB fusion issues under extreme conditions. We establish two synthetic and one real-world event-RGB semantic segmentation datasets for extreme scenario comparisons.

Existing joint registration-detection frameworks typically require retraining and transfer poorly across domains. We introduce a modular pipeline that improves spatial and temporal robustness without altering existing change detection networks. The framework integrates diffusion-based semantic morphing, dense registration, and residual flow refinement. A diffusion module synthesizes intermediate morphing frames that bridge large appearance gaps, enabling RoMa to estimate stepwise correspondences between consecutive frames. The composed flow is then refined through a lightweight U-Net to produce a high-fidelity warp that co-registers the original image pair. Extensive experiments on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and DSIFN-CD show consistent gains in both registration accuracy and downstream change detection across multiple backbones, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

SWAN supports both desktop and mobile platforms, offers real-time metadata capture, and allows flexible mapping of swipe gestures to class labels. In a pilot study with four pathologists annotating 600 mitotic figure image patches, we compared SWAN against a traditional folder-sorting workflow. SWAN enabled rapid annotations with pairwise percent agreement ranging from 86.52% to 93.68% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.61-0.80), while for the folder-based method, the pairwise percent agreement ranged from 86.98% to 91.32% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.63-0.75) for the task of classifying atypical versus normal mitotic figures, demonstrating high consistency between annotators and comparable performance.

To tackle this challenge, we propose NOTAM-Evolve, a self-evolving framework that enables a large language model (LLM) to autonomously master complex NOTAM interpretation. Leveraging a knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval module for data grounding, the framework introduces a closed-loop learning process where the LLM progressively improves from its own outputs, minimizing the need for extensive human-annotated reasoning traces.

Initially, we introduce a classification of additive and multiplicative fusion according to the inherent mechanisms of different fusion tasks. Then, dual encoders map source images into a shared latent space, capturing common content while isolating modality-specific details. During the decoding phase, dual decoders act as feature injectors, selectively reintegrating the unique characteristics of each modality into the shared content for reconstruction. The modality-specific features are injected into the source image in the fusion process, generating the fused image that integrates information from both modalities. The architecture of decoders varies according to their fusion mechanisms, enhancing both performance and interpretability.

With the rise of instruction-tuned decoder-only models, commonly known as large language models (LLMs), the field has increasingly moved toward zero-shot and few-shot prompting. However, the performance of LLMs on text classification, particularly on less-resourced languages, remains under-explored. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of current language models on text classification tasks across several South Slavic languages. We compare openly available fine-tuned BERT-like models with a selection of open-source and closed-source LLMs across three tasks in three domains: sentiment classification in parliamentary speeches, topic classification in news articles and parliamentary speeches, and genre identification in web texts. Our results show that LLMs demonstrate strong zero-shot performance, often matching or surpassing fine-tuned BERT-like models. Moreover, when used in a zero-shot setup, LLMs perform comparably in South Slavic languages and English. However, we also point out key drawbacks of LLMs, including less predictable outputs, significantly slower inference, and higher computational costs. Due to these limitations, fine-tuned BERT-like models remain a more practical choice for large-scale automatic text annotation."}

Experiments across 5 benchmarks with 3 structured data types demonstrate that our SCD achieves the best performance and superior generalization on small-scale LLM (8B) compared to other distillation methods, and closely approaches the performance of GPT4 on some datasets.

In image classification, such inconsistencies manifest as negative flips, where an updated model misclassifies test samples that were previously classified correctly. This issue becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of training classes grows over time, since adding new categories reduces the margin of each class and may introduce conflicting patterns that undermine their learning process, thereby degrading performance on the original subset. To mitigate negative flips, we propose a novel approach that preserves the margins of the original model while learning an improved one. Our method encourages a larger relative margin between the previously learned and newly introduced classes by introducing an explicit margin-calibration term on the logits. However, overly constraining the logit margin for the new classes can significantly degrade their accuracy compared to a new independently trained model. To address this, we integrate a double-source focal distillation loss with the previous model and a new independently trained model, learning an appropriate decision margin from both old and new data, even under a logit margin calibration. Extensive experiments on image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces the negative flip rate with high overall accuracy."}

Visual 3D detection based on RGB cameras provides a cost-effective solution compared to the LiDAR paradigm. While achieving promising detection accuracy, current deep neural network-based models remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples. The underlying safety concerns motivate us to investigate realistic adversarial attacks in AD scenarios. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of placing adversarial posters on the road surface to induce hallucinations in the detector. However, the unnatural appearance of the posters makes them easily noticeable by humans, and their fixed content can be readily targeted and defended. To address these limitations, we propose the AdvRoad to generate diverse road-style adversarial posters. The adversaries have naturalistic appearances resembling the road surface while compromising the detector to perceive non-existent objects at the attack locations. We employ a two-stage approach, termed Road-Style Adversary Generation and Scenario-Associated Adaptation, to maximize the attack effectiveness on the input scene while ensuring the natural appearance of the poster, allowing the attack to be carried out stealthily without drawing human attention. Extensive experiments show that AdvRoad generalizes well to different detectors, scenes, and spoofing locations.

While recent methods increasingly incorporate longitudinal information from prior mammograms, accurate spatial alignment across time points remains a key challenge. Misalignment can obscure meaningful tissue changes and degrade model performance. In this study, we provide insights into various alignment strategies, image-based registration, feature-level (representation space) alignment with and without regularization, and implicit alignment methods, for their effectiveness in longitudinal deep learning-based risk modeling. Using two large-scale mammography datasets, we assess each method across key metrics, including predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and deformation field quality.\n  Our results show that image-based registration consistently outperforms the more recently favored feature-based and implicit approaches across all metrics, enabling more accurate, temporally consistent predictions and generating smooth, anatomically plausible deformation fields. Although regularizing the deformation field improves deformation quality, it reduces the risk prediction performance of feature-level alignment. Applying image-based deformation fields within the feature space yields the best risk prediction performance.\n  These findings underscore the importance of image-based deformation fields for spatial alignment in longitudinal risk modeling, offering improved prediction accuracy and robustness. This approach has strong potential to enhance personalized screening and enable earlier interventions for high-risk individuals.

While unimodal detection methods have shown progress in identifying synthetic media, their inability to leverage cross-modal correlations and precisely localize forged segments limits their practicality against sophisticated, fine-grained manipulations. To address this, we introduce a multi-modal deepfake detection and localization framework based on a Feature Pyramid-Transformer (FPN-Transformer), addressing critical gaps in cross-modal generalization and temporal boundary regression. The proposed approach utilizes pre-trained self-supervised models (WavLM for audio, CLIP for video) to extract hierarchical temporal features. A multi-scale feature pyramid is constructed through R-TLM blocks with localized attention mechanisms, enabling joint analysis of cross-context temporal dependencies. The dual-branch prediction head simultaneously predicts forgery probabilities and refines temporal offsets of manipulated segments, achieving frame-level localization precision. We evaluate our approach on the test set of the IJCAI'25 DDL-AV benchmark, showing a good performance with a final score of 0.7535 for cross-modal deepfake detection and localization in challenging environments. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach and provide a novel way for generalized deepfake detection. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/MM-DDL"}

Data augmentation offers a promising approach to increasing the size and diversity of training data, where faithfulness and diversity are two critical factors to effectiveness. However, promoting untargeted diversity can result in redundant samples with limited utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based data augmentation approach, Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation (SASG-DA). To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples. To enhance targeted diversity, we further introduce a Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling strategy to explicitly explore underrepresented regions, improving distribution coverage and sample utility. Extensive experiments on benchmark sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7, demonstrate that SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods. Overall, our proposed data augmentation approach effectively mitigates overfitting and improves recognition performance and generalization by offering both faithful and diverse samples."}

Two widely used techniques to address this challenge are weight quantization, which lowers the precision of all weights, and structured sparsity, which removes unimportant weights while retaining the important ones at full precision. Although both are effective individually, they are typically studied in isolation due to their compounded negative impact on model accuracy when combined. In this work, we introduce SLOPE Structured Sparsity at Low Precision), a unified framework, to effectively combine structured sparsity and low-bit quantization in a principled way. We show that naively combining sparsity and quantization severely harms performance due to the compounded impact of both techniques. To address this, we propose a training-time regularization strategy that minimizes the discrepancy between full-precision weights and their sparse, quantized counterparts by promoting angular alignment rather than direct matching. On ResNet-18, SLOPE achieves $\\sim20\\times$ model size reduction while retaining $\\sim$99% of the original accuracy.

To do so, we perform probing on Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers that predict semantic attributes for objects and evaluate these predictions against human annotations. Surprisingly, we find that this success can actually be attributed to the text encoding occurring in CLIP rather than the reverse diffusion process. We demonstrate that groups of specific semantic attributes have markedly different decoding accuracy than the average, and are thus represented to different degrees. Finally, we show that attributes become more difficult to disambiguate from one another during the inverse diffusion process, further demonstrating the strongest semantic representation of object attributes in CLIP. We conclude that the separately trained CLIP vision-language model is what determines the human-like semantic representation, and that the diffusion process instead takes the role of a visual decoder."}

While various retrospective motion correction methods exist, many struggle to generalize across different motion types and body regions. In particular, machine learning (ML)-based corrections are often tailored to specific applications and datasets. We hypothesize that motion artifacts, though diverse, share underlying patterns that can be disentangled and exploited. To address this, we propose a hierarchical vector-quantized (VQ) variational auto-encoder that learns a disentangled embedding of motion-to-clean image features. A codebook is deployed to capture finite collection of motion patterns at multiple resolutions, enabling coarse-to-fine correction. An auto-regressive model is trained to learn the prior distribution of motion-free images and is used at inference to guide the correction process. Unlike conventional approaches, our method does not require artifact-specific training and can generalize to unseen motion patterns. We demonstrate the approach on simulated whole-body motion artifacts and observe robust correction across varying motion severity. Our results suggest that the model effectively disentangled physical motion of the simulated motion-effective scans, therefore, improving the generalizability of the ML-based MRI motion correction. Our work of disentangling the motion features shed a light on its potential application across anatomical regions and motion types."}

BARD10 is a curated corpus of Bangla blog and opinion prose from ten contemporary authors, alongside the methodical assessment of four representative classifiers: SVM (Support Vector Machine), Bangla BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), XGBoost, and a MLP (Multilayer Perception), utilizing uniform preprocessing on both BARD10 and the benchmark corpora BAAD16 (Bangla Authorship Attribution Dataset of 16 authors). In all datasets, the classical TF-IDF + SVM baseline outperformed, attaining a macro-F1 score of 0.997 on BAAD16 and 0.921 on BARD10, while Bangla BERT lagged by as much as five points. This study reveals that BARD10 authors are highly sensitive to stop-word pruning, while BAAD16 authors remain comparatively robust highlighting genre-dependent reliance on stop-word signatures. Error analysis revealed that high frequency components transmit authorial signatures that are diminished or reduced by transformer models. Three insights are identified: Bangla stop-words serve as essential stylistic indicators; finely calibrated ML models prove effective within short-text limitations; and BARD10 connects formal literature with contemporary web dialogue, offering a reproducible benchmark for future long-context or domain-adapted transformers."}

The success of RoPE has been thought to be due to its positional equivariance, i.e. its status as a relative positional encoding. In this paper, we mathematically show RoPE to be one of the most general solutions for equivariant positional embedding in one-dimensional data. Moreover, we show Mixed RoPE to be the analogously general solution for M-dimensional data, if we require commutative generators -- a property necessary for RoPE's equivariance. However, we question whether strict equivariance plays a large role in RoPE's performance. We propose Spherical RoPE, a method analogous to Mixed RoPE, but assumes non-commutative generators. Empirically, we find Spherical RoPE to have the equivalent or better learning behavior compared to its equivariant analogues. This suggests that relative positional embeddings are not as important as is commonly believed, at least within computer vision. We expect this discovery to facilitate future work in positional encodings for vision that can be faster and generalize better by removing the preconception that they must be relative."}

Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets.

However, recent research reveals that LLMs still exhibit performance gaps in Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) as requiring fine-grained comprehension. The commonly adopted \"extract entities then predict relations\" paradigm in LLM-based methods leads to these gaps due to two main reasons: (1) Numerous unrelated entity pairs introduce noise and interfere with the relation prediction for truly related entity pairs. (2) Although LLMs have identified semantic associations between entities, relation labels beyond the predefined set are still treated as prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Relation as a Prior (RelPrior) paradigm for LLM-based DocRE. For challenge (1), RelPrior utilizes binary relation as a prior to extract and determine whether two entities are correlated, thereby filtering out irrelevant entity pairs and reducing prediction noise. For challenge (2), RelPrior utilizes predefined relation as a prior to match entities for triples extraction instead of directly predicting relation.

Current state-of-the-art methods learn a single, entangled forgery representation--conflating content-dependent flaws with content-agnostic artifacts--and are further constrained by outdated benchmarks. To overcome these limitations, we propose OmniAID, a novel framework centered on a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The core of our method is a hybrid expert system engineered to decouple: (1) semantic flaws across distinct content domains, and (2) these content-dependent flaws from content-agnostic universal artifacts. This system employs a set of Routable Specialized Semantic Experts, each for a distinct domain (e.g., human, animal), complemented by a Fixed Universal Artifact Expert. This architecture is trained using a bespoke two-stage strategy: we first train the experts independently with domain-specific hard-sampling to ensure specialization, and subsequently train a lightweight gating network for effective input routing. By explicitly decoupling \"what is generated\" (content-specific flaws) from \"how it is generated\" (universal artifacts), OmniAID achieves robust generalization. To address outdated benchmarks and validate real-world applicability, we introduce Mirage, a new large-scale, contemporary dataset. Extensive experiments, using both traditional benchmarks and our Mirage dataset, demonstrate our model surpasses existing monolithic detectors, establishing a new, robust standard for AIGI authentication against modern, in-the-wild threats."}

This article presents an embedding-based benchmarking framework to detect bias in LLMs in the context of formative feedback. Using 600 authentic student essays from the AES 2.0 corpus, we constructed controlled counterfactuals along two dimensions: (i) implicit cues via lexicon-based swaps of gendered terms within essays, and (ii) explicit cues via gendered author background in the prompt. We investigated six representative LLMs (i.e. GPT-5 mini, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3-8B). We first quantified the response divergence with cosine and Euclidean distances over sentence embeddings, then assessed significance via permutation tests, and finally, visualised structure using dimensionality reduction. In all models, implicit manipulations reliably induced larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than for female-male. Only the GPT and Llama models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues. These findings show that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit asymmetric semantic responses to gender substitutions, suggesting persistent gender biases in feedback they provide learners. Qualitative analyses further revealed consistent linguistic differences (e.g., more autonomy-supportive feedback under male cues vs. more controlling feedback under female cues). We discuss implications for fairness auditing of pedagogical GenAI, propose reporting standards for counterfactual evaluation in learning analytics, and outline practical guidance for prompt design and deployment to safeguard equitable feedback."}

These methods capture model decision patterns but may overlook class-discriminative signals that are crucial for distinguishing between tumor subtypes. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Integrated Gradients (CIG), a novel attribution method that enhances interpretability by computing contrastive gradients in logit space. First, CIG highlights class-discriminative regions by comparing feature importance relative to a reference class, offering sharper differentiation between tumor and non-tumor areas. Second, CIG satisfies the axioms of integrated attribution, ensuring consistency and theoretical soundness. Third, we propose two attribution quality metrics, MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, which measure how predictive information and model confidence evolve with access to salient regions, particularly under weak supervision. We validate CIG across three datasets spanning distinct cancer types: CAMELYON16 (breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes), TCGA-RCC (renal cell carcinoma), and TCGA-Lung (lung cancer).

Then, we learn to project the vision features to group related semantics, among which are more likely to have relationships. Finally, we fuse the visual features with the textual by using inheritable cross-attention, where we globally remove the redundant visual relationships by discarding visual-language feature pairs with low correlation.

Code is available at: https://github.com/wxszreal0/DiPVNet", "summary": "Point cloud processing has become a cornerstone technology in many 3D vision tasks. However, arbitrary rotations introduce variations in point cloud orientations, posing a long-standing challenge for effective representation learning. The core of this issue is the disruption of the point cloud's intrinsic directional characteristics caused by rotational perturbations. Recent methods attempt to implicitly model rotational equivariance and invariance, preserving directional information and propagating it into deep semantic spaces. Yet, they often fall short of fully exploiting the multiscale directional nature of point clouds to enhance feature representations. To address this, we propose the Direction-Perceptive Vector Network (DiPVNet). At its core is an atomic dot-product operator that simultaneously encodes directional selectivity and rotation invariance--endowing the network with both rotational symmetry modeling and adaptive directional perception. At the local level, we introduce a Learnable Local Dot-Product (L2DP) Operator, which enables interactions between a center point and its neighbors to adaptively capture the non-uniform local structures of point clouds. At the global level, we leverage generalized harmonic analysis to prove that the dot-product between point clouds and spherical sampling vectors is equivalent to a direction-aware spherical Fourier transform (DASFT). This leads to the construction of a global directional response spectrum for modeling holistic directional structures. We rigorously prove the rotation invariance of both operators. Extensive experiments on challenging scenarios involving noise and large-angle rotations demonstrate that DiPVNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on point cloud classification and segmentation tasks.

An effective embedding is expected to comprehensively preserve the semantic content of the input while simultaneously emphasizing features that are discriminative for downstream tasks. Recent approaches demonstrate that VLMs can be adapted into competitive embedding models via large-scale contrastive learning, enabling the simultaneous optimization of two complementary objectives. We argue that the two aforementioned objectives can be decoupled: a comprehensive understanding of the input facilitates the embedding model in achieving superior performance in downstream tasks via contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose CoMa, a compressed pre-training phase, which serves as a warm-up stage for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate that with only a small amount of pre-training data, we can transform a VLM into a competitive embedding model. CoMa achieves new state-of-the-art results among VLMs of comparable size on the MMEB, realizing optimization in both efficiency and effectiveness."}

This spatial diffusion process encourages propagation across connected and semantically related areas, enabling it to effectively delineate objects with arbitrary shapes.

While existing approaches focus on refining responses within a single LLM, this method struggles to consider diverse aspects needed for effective conversations. In this work, we propose refining responses through a multi-agent framework, where each agent is assigned a specific role for each aspect. We focus on three key aspects crucial to conversational quality: factuality, personalization, and coherence. Each agent is responsible for reviewing and refining one of these aspects, and their feedback is then merged to improve the overall response. To enhance collaboration among them, we introduce a dynamic communication strategy. Instead of following a fixed sequence of agents, our approach adaptively selects and coordinates the most relevant agents based on the specific requirements of each query.

However, promoting untargeted diversity can result in redundant samples with limited utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based data augmentation approach, Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation (SASG-DA). To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples.

Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) evaluate the reasoning process but require costly human annotations or rollout generation. While implicit PRM is trained only with outcome signals and derives step rewards through reward parameterization without explicit annotations, it is more suitable for multi-step reasoning in MHQA tasks. However, existing implicit PRM has only been explored for plain text scenarios. When adapting to MHQA tasks, it cannot handle the graph structure constraints in KGs and capture the potential inconsistency between CoT and KG paths. To address these limitations, we propose the DPRM (Dual Implicit Process Reward Model). It trains two implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks. Both PRMs, namely KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization without additional explicit annotations. Among them, KG-PRM uses preference pairs to learn structural constraints from KGs. DPRM further introduces a consistency constraint between CoT and KG reasoning steps, making the two PRMs mutually verify and collaboratively optimize the reasoning paths. We also provide a theoretical demonstration of the derivation of process rewards. Experimental results show that our method outperforms 13 baselines on multiple datasets with up to 16.6% improvement on Hit@1."}

Furthermore, their implicit volumetric representations differ significantly from the widely adopted polygonal meshes, making rendering and manipulation inefficient in standard 3D software. In this work, we propose a robust framework that reconstructs high-quality, editable 3D meshes directly from multi-view images with noisy extrinsic parameters. Our approach jointly refines camera poses while learning an implicit scene representation that captures fine geometric detail and photorealistic appearance. The resulting meshes are compatible with common 3D graphics and robotics tools, enabling efficient downstream use.

The success of RoPE has been thought to be due to its positional equivariance, i.e. its status as a relative positional encoding. In this paper, we mathematically show RoPE to be one of the most general solutions for equivariant positional embedding in one-dimensional data. Moreover, we show Mixed RoPE to be the analogously general solution for M-dimensional data, if we require commutative generators -- a property necessary for RoPE's equivariance. However, we question whether strict equivariance plays a large role in RoPE's performance. We propose Spherical RoPE, a method analogous to Mixed RoPE, but assumes non-commutative generators. Empirically, we find Spherical RoPE to have the equivalent or better learning behavior compared to its equivariant analogues. This suggests that relative positional embeddings are not as important as is commonly believed, at least within computer vision. We expect this discovery to facilitate future work in positional encodings for vision that can be faster and generalize better by removing the preconception that they must be relative."}

While satellite-based imaging spectrometers, such as EMIT, PRISMA, and EnMAP, can detect these point sources, current methane retrieval methods based on matched filters still produce a high number of false detections requiring laborious manual verification. This paper describes the operational deployment of a machine learning system for detecting methane emissions within the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) of the United Nations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We created the largest and most diverse global dataset of annotated methane plumes from three imaging spectrometer missions and quantitatively compared different deep learning model configurations. Focusing on the requirements for operational deployment, we extended prior evaluation methodologies from small tiled datasets to full granule evaluation. This revealed that deep learning models still produce a large number of false detections, a problem we address with model ensembling, which reduced false detections by over 74%. Deployed in the MARS pipeline, our system processes scenes and proposes plumes to analysts, accelerating the detection and analysis process. During seven months of operational deployment, it facilitated the verification of 1,351 distinct methane leaks, resulting in 479 stakeholder notifications. We further demonstrate the model's utility in verifying mitigation success through case studies in Libya, Argentina, Oman, and Azerbaijan. Our work represents a critical step towards a global AI-assisted methane leak detection system, which is required to process the dramatically higher data volumes expected from new and current imaging spectrometers."}

Our central finding is that a reward model trained only on these structural signals achieves a pairwise accuracy (68.20%) comparable to a powerful LLM baseline that analyzes the full transcript (70.04%). Furthermore, a hybrid model combining interaction dynamics with textual analysis achieves the highest performance (80.17%), demonstrating their complementary nature.

These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a \"window\" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

Achieving expert-level diagnostic decisions requires integration of subtle image features with clinical knowledge. Yet major vision-language models (VLMs) treat images as holistic entities and overlook fine-grained image details that are vital for disease diagnosis. Clinicians analyze images by utilizing their prior medical knowledge and identify anatomical structures as important region of interests (ROIs). Inspired from this human-centric workflow, we introduce Anatomy-VLM, a fine-grained, vision-language model that incorporates multi-scale information. First, we design a model encoder to localize key anatomical features from entire medical images. Second, these regions are enriched with structured knowledge for contextually-aware interpretation. Finally, the model encoder aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease prediction. Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets. We also validate the performance of Anatomy-VLM on downstream image segmentation tasks, suggesting that its fine-grained alignment captures anatomical and pathology-related knowledge.

While Integrated Gradients (IG) and related attribution methods have shown promise, applying them directly to WSIs introduces challenges due to their high-resolution nature. These methods capture model decision patterns but may overlook class-discriminative signals that are crucial for distinguishing between tumor subtypes. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Integrated Gradients (CIG), a novel attribution method that enhances interpretability by computing contrastive gradients in logit space. First, CIG highlights class-discriminative regions by comparing feature importance relative to a reference class, offering sharper differentiation between tumor and non-tumor areas. Second, CIG satisfies the axioms of integrated attribution, ensuring consistency and theoretical soundness. Third, we propose two attribution quality metrics, MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, which measure how predictive information and model confidence evolve with access to salient regions, particularly under weak supervision. We validate CIG across three datasets spanning distinct cancer types: CAMELYON16 (breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes), TCGA-RCC (renal cell carcinoma), and TCGA-Lung (lung cancer). Experimental results demonstrate that CIG yields more informative attributions both quantitatively, using MIL-AIC and MIL-SIC, and qualitatively, through visualizations that align closely with ground truth tumor regions, underscoring its potential for interpretable and trustworthy WSI-based diagnostics"}

We find that, for moral robustness, model family accounts for most of the variance, while model size shows no systematic effect. The Claude family is, by a significant margin, the most robust, followed by Gemini and GPT-4 models, with other families exhibiting lower robustness.

Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively.

When trained with only tens of thousands of example explanations, explainer models exhibit non-trivial generalization to new queries. This generalization appears partly attributable to explainer models' privileged access to their own internals: using a model to explain its own computations generally works better than using a *different* model to explain its computations (even if the other model is significantly more capable).
