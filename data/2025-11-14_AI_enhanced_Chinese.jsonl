Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation.

Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels.

In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability.

However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead.

Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-\u03b1 constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u6784(PPR)\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408PJAR\u6846\u67b6\u548cLarge-\u03b1\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8054\u5408\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u914d(JRA)\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212(MIP)\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u9707\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u7ea61%\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u90e8\u5206\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u6784(PPR)\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7269\u54c1-\u5360\u4f4d\u7b26\u5bf9\u5f62\u6210\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\uff1b\u5229\u7528PJAR\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u521d\u59cb\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5408\u5e76\u89e3\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7PPR\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6cbf\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u8fed\u4ee3\u6253\u78e8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u5728JRA\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u5168\u5c40Large-\u03b1\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728n=300\u3001500\u548c1000\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u4f9b\u51e0\u4e4e\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u4e3a0.00%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u504f\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u4e00\u534a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728JRA\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5728\u65c5\u884c\u5546\u95ee\u9898(TSP)\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors.

To systematically analyze this issue, we propose ParaBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image. To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework, MMaDA-Parallel, that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. MMaDA-Parallel is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (ParaRL), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our model significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9\\% improvement in Output Alignment on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.

This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences. The results of this analysis show clearly that language transfer is asymmetric.

We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative. We provide ablations over gate type and prefix length and use a delta-latency view to make budget trade-offs explicit.", "AI": {"tldr": "TARG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u95e8\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8349\u7a3f\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1RAG\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u68c0\u7d22\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u90fd\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u589e\u52a0token\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u89e6\u53d1\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "TARG\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8349\u7a3f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e09\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff08\u5e73\u5747token\u71b5\u3001\u57fa\u4e8etop-1/top-2 logit\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u6216\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u968f\u673a\u524d\u7f00\u65b9\u5dee\uff09\u6765\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u89e6\u53d1\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f53\u5206\u6570\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u624d\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728NQ-Open\u3001TriviaQA\u548cPopQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTARG\u76f8\u6bd4Always-RAG\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u76f8\u540c\u7684EM/F1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8670-90%\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5176\u5f00\u9500\u63a5\u8fd1Never-RAG\u3002\u8fb9\u9645\u4fe1\u53f7\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u662f\u6700\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "TARG\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RAG\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

It occurs on a continuum from mild to severe, and treatment options can vary based on severity. Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.

Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more and more data. Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.\n  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are key requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u65e8\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6ce8\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5bf9\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u3001\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u4e00\u76f4\u662fAI\u5904\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u6697\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u5927\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u589e\u591a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e0d\u65ad\uff0c\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u5c06\u6c47\u805a\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u79d1\u548cAI\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8005\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6280\u672f\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8c03\u548c\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4e0e\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6d4b\u91cf\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5411\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u6267\u884c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u548c\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ca\u5176\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u4e3a\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4ea4\u6d41\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

First, there are misalignments between words in the lexicon and the word segmentation model. Second, a Khmer word can be written in different forms. Third, Khmer compound words are often loosely and easily formed, and these compound words are not always found in the lexicon. Fourth, some proper nouns may be flagged as misspellings due to the absence of a Khmer named-entity recognition (NER) model. Unfortunately, existing solutions do not adequately address these challenges. This paper proposes a holistic approach to the Khmer spellchecking problem by integrating Khmer subword segmentation, Khmer NER, Khmer grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion, and a Khmer language model to tackle these challenges, identify potential correction candidates, and rank the most suitable candidate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art Khmer spellchecking accuracy of up to 94.4%, compared to existing solutions. The benchmark datasets for Khmer spellchecking and NER tasks in this study will be made publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bed\u62fc\u5199\u68c0\u67e5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\u3001\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u5b57\u5f62\u5230\u8bed\u97f3\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8694.4%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bed\u62fc\u5199\u68c0\u67e5\u76f8\u6bd4\u82f1\u8bed\u7b49\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u8bcd\u5178\u4e0e\u5206\u8bcd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3001\u540c\u4e00\u5355\u8bcd\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u5199\u6cd5\u3001\u590d\u5408\u8bcd\u6784\u6210\u677e\u6563\u4e14\u4e0d\u5728\u8bcd\u5178\u4e2d\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e13\u6709\u540d\u8bcd\u88ab\u8bef\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6574\u4f53\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bed\u5b50\u8bcd\u5206\u8bcd\u3001\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bedNER\u3001\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bedG2P\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0a\u8ff0\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u5019\u9009\u5e76\u6392\u5e8f\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5019\u9009\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe94.4%\u7684\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bed\u62fc\u5199\u68c0\u67e5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u68c9\u8bed\u62fc\u5199\u68c0\u67e5\u548cNER\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency. We apply SliderEdit to state-of-the-art image editing models, including FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, and observe substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore and propose a framework for continuous, fine-grained instruction control in instruction-based image editing models.

The proposed method integrates a denoising probabilistic model that utilizes diffusion processes to generate high-quality crowd density maps. To improve accuracy, narrow Gaussian kernels are employed, and multiple density map outputs are generated. A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including overlay plots and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the model demonstrates its ability to effectively capture crowd dynamics in both dense and sparse settings. The efficiency of the sampling method is further assessed, showcasing its capability to decrease frame counts while maintaining essential crowd events.

Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift. All our results are on Qwen2-Audio; they demonstrate that Rebellion: 1) can protect against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and 2) significantly improves accuracy-safety trade-off over standard RT method.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset.

Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $60$ AxA configurations, $3$ domains, and $2000+$ conversations, we demonstrate that echoing occurs across three major LLM providers, with echoing rates from $5\\%$ to $70\\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\\%$) that are not reduced by increased reasoning efforts. We analyze prompt impacts, conversation dynamics, showing that echoing arises as interaction grows longer ($7+$ turns in experiments) and is not merely an artifact of sub-optimal prompting. Finally, we introduce a protocol-level mitigation in which targeted use of structured responses reduces echoing to $9\\%$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\"\u56de\u58f0\u73b0\u8c61\"\u2014\u2014\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u653e\u5f03\u5176\u6307\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u800c\u6a21\u4eff\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe5%-70%", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ea4\u4e92\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u5355\u4e00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0\u5931\u8d25\u7c7b\u522b\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53-\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u4fe1\u53f7", "method": "\u901a\u8fc760\u79cdAxA\u914d\u7f6e\u30013\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u30012000+\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u56de\u58f0\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u56de\u58f0\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u4e09\u5927LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u4e2d\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u4ecd\u8fbe32.8%\uff1b\u968f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8f6e\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u52a0\u5267\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u534f\u8bae\u53ef\u5c06\u56de\u58f0\u7387\u964d\u81f39%", "conclusion": "\u56de\u58f0\u73b0\u8c61\u662fLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u534f\u8bae\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ef4\u6301\u5176\u9884\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u548c\u76ee\u6807"}}

This weakness in terminology-level representation can severely hinder downstream tasks such as legal judgment prediction or financial risk analysis, where subtle semantic distinctions are critical. To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues. We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination. To support robust evaluation, we construct the first financial terminology dataset derived from official regulatory documents.

Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline. Moreover, the proposed model consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models across most test sets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3aSocial LSTM\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u6539\u5584\u52a8\u6001\u62e5\u6324\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u884c\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u62e5\u6324\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u884c\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u884c\u4eba\u89c6\u4e3a\u70b9\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u5360\u7528\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u589e\u5f3aSocial LSTM\u3002\u8be5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\uff0c\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u7a7a\u95f4\u5360\u7528\u5177\u6709\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u91cc\u66022022\u5e74\u706f\u5149\u8282\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u884c\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c06\u78b0\u649e\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe31%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e5%\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e6%\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u884c\u4eba\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5360\u7528\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u70b9\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales. Across six math-reasoning benchmarks, InTRO consistently outperforms other baselines, raising solution accuracy by up to 20% relative to the base model. Its chains of thought are also notably more concise, exhibiting reduced verbosity. Beyond this, InTRO enables cross-domain transfer, successfully adapting to out-of-domain reasoning tasks that extend beyond the realm of mathematics, demonstrating robust generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "InTRO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684LLM\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7token\u7ea7\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u81ea\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe20%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u5355\u4e00\"\u9ec4\u91d1\"\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u60e9\u7f5a\u5176\u4ed6\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u56f0\u96be\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInTRO\uff08In-Token Rationality Optimization\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6821\u6b63\u56e0\u5b50\uff08token\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6743\u91cd\uff09\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u5176\u7b54\u6848\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5bf9\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0token\u7ea7\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u5b8c\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cInTRO consistently\u8d85\u8d8a\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534720%\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u5176\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u66f4\u52a0\u7b80\u6d01\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5197\u957f\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cInTRO\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u9002\u5e94\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u8303\u56f4\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u57df\u5916\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "InTRO\u4e3aLLM\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7token\u7ea7\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u81ea\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human \"gold\" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication.

Prasanna"], "title": "HierRouter: Coordinated Routing of Specialized Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver state-of-the-art performance across many tasks but impose high computational and memory costs, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained or real-time settings. To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average. These results highlight the promise of hierarchical routing for cost-efficient, high-performance LLM inference.

It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e868\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u533b\u5b66\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u663e\u8457\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ec6\u5fae\u75c5\u7406\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u975e\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u524d\u666f\u5e7f\u9614\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9886\u57df\uff08\u533b\u5b66vs\u901a\u7528\uff09\u3001\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e868\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6c14\u80f8\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u80a5\u5927\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6c14\u80f8\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b50\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u533b\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u7279\u5f81\u6548\u7528\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u663e\u8457\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ec6\u5fae\u75c5\u7406\uff08\u5982\u6c14\u80f8\uff09\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u6dc6\u6377\u5f84\uff08\u5982\u7528\u80f8\u7ba1\u5224\u65ad\u6c14\u80f8\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5931\u6548\u3002\u56fe\u50cf-only\uff08RAD-DINO\uff09\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\uff08Ark+\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u76d1\u7763\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6781\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533b\u5b66\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u76ca\u4f46\u5e76\u975e\u4e07\u80fd\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u5982\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff09\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u975e\u666e\u904d\u6709\u6548\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u662f\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Deployable locally, these models offer artists vital control over infrastructure and code, unlike dominant large, closed-source corporate systems. Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model.

However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains. Additionally, we validate EnchTable can be seamlessly integrated into various deployment pipelines without significant overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "EnchTable\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NTK\u5b89\u5168\u5411\u91cf\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u611f\u77e5\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u5f80\u5f80\u51fa\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u964d\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEnchTable\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838(NTK)\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5411\u91cf\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u8026\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e72\u6270\u611f\u77e5\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57283\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u57df\u30013\u79cdLLM\u67b6\u6784\u548c11\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEnchTable\u76f8\u6bd46\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u4fee\u6539\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c2\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "EnchTable\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u90e8\u7f72\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u9000\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we introduce SlideBot - a modular, multi-agent slide generation framework that integrates LLMs with retrieval, structured planning, and code generation. SlideBot is organized around three pillars: informativeness, ensuring deep and contextually grounded content; reliability, achieved by incorporating external sources through retrieval; and practicality, which enables customization and iterative feedback through instructor collaboration. It incorporates evidence-based instructional design principles from Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML), using structured planning to manage intrinsic load and consistent visual macros to reduce extraneous load and enhance dual-channel learning. Within the system, specialized agents collaboratively retrieve information, summarize content, generate figures, and format slides using LaTeX, aligning outputs with instructor preferences through interactive refinement.

The model fuses indistinct speech with high-frame-rate lip dynamics, enabling both translation and dialogue within a single multimodal framework. To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness.

However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation. Another key innovation is our automatic re-registration mechanism that detects tracking failures through feature similarity monitoring and recovers from severe occlusions or rapid motion. STORM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging industrial datasets featuring multi-object occlusions, high-speed motion, and varying illumination, while operating at real-time speeds without additional training.

Unlike factual commonsense, norm reasoning is subjective, context-dependent, and varies across cultures, posing challenges for computational models. Prior works provide valuable normative annotations but mostly target isolated utterances or synthetic dialogues, limiting their ability to capture the fluid, multi-turn nature of real-world conversations. In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations. Each turn is annotated for norm category and adherence status using multi-annotator consensus, reflecting cross-cultural and realistic norm expression.

While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "PANDA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5b58\u50a8\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65e0\u793a\u4f8b\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ea7\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u90e8\u6781\u7aef\u6216\u503e\u659c\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "PANDA\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210CLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4e\u9891\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u533a\u57df\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u9ad8\u9891\u7c7b\u522b\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u5e73\u6ed1\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u6837\u672c\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePANDA\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "PANDA\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u65e0\u793a\u4f8b\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a \"simulated textbook\" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760LLM\u751f\u6210\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u624b\u5de5\u8bc6\u522b\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e14\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u4f59\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4o-mini\u5c06\"\u6a21\u62df\u6559\u79d1\u4e66\"LLM\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u6269\u5c55\u5230646\u9053\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u7684\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6807\u7b7e\u5408\u5e76\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u59cbLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff08RMSE 0.4285 vs \u4e13\u5bb60.4206\uff09\u4e14\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u591aKC\uff08569\u4e2a vs 101\u4e2a\uff09\uff1b\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea60.8\u9608\u503c\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5c06KC\u6570\u91cf\u964d\u81f3428\u4e2a\uff0cRMSE\u6539\u5584\u81f30.4259\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760\u6269\u5c55\u7684LLM\u751f\u6210\u662f\u4e0d\u591f\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Metaxas"], "title": "Test-Time Spectrum-Aware Latent Steering for Zero-Shot Generalization in Vision-Language Models", "comment": "NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but often degrade under test-time domain shifts. For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks.

Developed in collaboration with EMS experts and aligned with national standards, EgoEMS is captured using an open-source, low-cost, and replicable data collection system and is annotated with keysteps, timestamped audio transcripts with speaker diarization, action quality metrics, and bounding boxes with segmentation masks. Emphasizing realism, the dataset includes responder-patient interactions reflecting real-world emergency dynamics.

We present a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models for veracity prediction on numerical claims and evidence pairs using controlled perturbations, including label-flipping probes, to test robustness. Our results indicate that even leading proprietary systems experience accuracy drops of up to 62\\% under certain perturbations. No model proves to be robust across all conditions. We further find that increasing context length generally reduces accuracy, but when extended context is enriched with perturbed demonstrations, most models substantially recover.

First, AlphaDE fine-tunes pretrained protein language models using masked language modeling on homologous protein sequences to activate the evolutionary plausibility for the interested protein class. Second, AlphaDE introduces test-time inference based on Monte Carlo tree search, which effectively evolves proteins with evolutionary guidance from the fine-tuned protein language model.

Animating Human Avatars in Diverse Scenes with Gaussian Splatting", "comment": null, "summary": "We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04(3DGS)\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u4eba\u7269\u52a8\u753b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u7ba1\u9053\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u7f51\u683c\u6216\u70b9\u4e91\u4f5c\u4e3a3D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u800c3DGS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u753b\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5145\u5206\u5229\u75283DGS\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4eba\u7269\u548c\u573a\u666f\u90fd\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u9ad8\u65af\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u9ad8\u65af\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u4eba\u7269\u653e\u7f6e\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u9ad8\u65af\u7ec6\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "result": "\u5728Scannet++\u548cSuperSplat\u5e93\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4eba\u7269\u6355\u83b7\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5316\u8eab\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u7b49\u65b0\u9896\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e863DGS\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u52a8\u753b\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c063DGS\u5f15\u5165\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u753b\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u4eba\u7269-\u573a\u666f\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u753b\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.\n  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data. Experiments across three multilingual datasets and multiple typologically diverse languages show that SCD consistently improves language alignment and task performance, providing an effective and generalizable solution in multilingual RAG.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u8a00RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801(SCD)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\u6765\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u975e\u9884\u671f\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u548cLLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u6e90\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u574d\u584c\u800c\u975e\u7406\u89e3\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801(SCD)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u6807\u8bb0\u6765\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5730\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u82f1\u8bed\u5728\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5145\u5f53\u8bed\u4e49\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff0c\u65e2\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u5e72\u6270\u6e90\u4e5f\u662f\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u56de\u9000\u8bed\u8a00\u3002SCD\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6f\u7ea6\u675f\u89e3\u7801\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00RAG\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

These attacks can be physically deployed, posing serious risks to real-world applications. In this paper, we propose CertMask, a certifiably robust defense that constructs a provably sufficient set of binary masks to neutralize patch effects with strong theoretical guarantees. While the state-of-the-art approach (PatchCleanser) requires two rounds of masking and incurs $O(n^2)$ inference cost, CertMask performs only a single round of masking with $O(n)$ time complexity, where $n$ is the cardinality of the mask set to cover an input image. Our proposed mask set is computed using a mathematically rigorous coverage strategy that ensures each possible patch location is covered at least $k$ times, providing both efficiency and robustness. We offer a theoretical analysis of the coverage condition and prove its sufficiency for certification.

However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models. Moreover, a solver trained on the synthesized data provides improved rewards for continued generator training, enabling co-evolution and yielding a further 0.7% performance gain.

Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions.

Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided.

This has revolutionized various sectors such as healthcare, software development, and education. In education, LLMs offer potential for personalized and interactive learning experiences, especially in regions with limited teaching resources. However, adapting these models effectively to curriculum-specific content, such as the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus in India, presents unique challenges in terms of accuracy, alignment, and pedagogical relevance. In this paper, we present the framework \"PustakAI\"\\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset \"NCERT-QA\" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8.

Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball. We design an adjustable multiplier to select the appropriate RKHS corresponding to the hyperbolic space with any curvature adaptively. Building on this foundation, we further construct a family of adaptive hyperbolic kernels, including the novel adaptive hyperbolic radial kernel, whose learnable parameters modulate hyperbolic features in a task-aware manner.

While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text.

However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence.

SPAN features ten cross-calendar temporal reasoning directions, two reasoning types, and two question formats across six calendars. To enable time-variant and contamination-free evaluation, we propose a template-driven protocol for dynamic instance generation that enables assessment on a user-specified Gregorian date. We conduct extensive experiments on both open- and closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs over a range of dates spanning 100 years from 1960 to 2060. Our evaluations show that these LLMs achieve an average accuracy of only 34.5%, with none exceeding 80%, indicating that this task remains challenging. Through in-depth analysis of reasoning types, question formats, and temporal reasoning directions, we identify two key obstacles for LLMs: Future-Date Degradation and Calendar Asymmetry Bias. To strengthen LLMs' cross-calendar temporal reasoning capability, we further develop an LLM-powered Time Agent that leverages tool-augmented code generation. Empirical results show that Time Agent achieves an average accuracy of 95.31%, outperforming several competitive baselines, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented code generation to advance cross-calendar temporal reasoning.

To this end, we present LEX-ICON, an extensive mimetic word dataset consisting of 8,052 words from four natural languages (English, French, Japanese, and Korean) and 2,930 systematically constructed pseudo-words, annotated with semantic features applied across both text and audio modalities. Our key findings demonstrate (1) MLLMs' phonetic intuitions that align with existing linguistic research across multiple semantic dimensions and (2) phonosemantic attention patterns that highlight models' focus on iconic phonemes.

Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries.

Central to our approach is a novel Planner model that performs global Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) planning for complex queries, enabling optimized execution beyond conventional tool coordination. We also introduce ComplexTool-Plan, a large-scale benchmark dataset featuring complex queries that demand sophisticated multi-tool composition and coordination capabilities. Additionally, we develop a two-stage training methodology that integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), systematically enhancing the Planner's tool selection accuracy and global planning awareness through structured DAG-based planning.

ADI-20 covers all Arabic-speaking countries' dialects. It comprises 3,556 hours from 19 Arabic dialects in addition to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). We used this dataset to train and evaluate various state-of-the-art ADI systems. We explored fine-tuning pre-trained ECAPA-TDNN-based models, as well as Whisper encoder blocks coupled with an attention pooling layer and a classification dense layer.

Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HCC-3D not only achieves extreme compression ratios (approximately 98%) compared to previous 3D-VLMs, but also achieves new state-of-the-art performance, showing the great improvements on both efficiency and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "HCC-3D\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u8865\u507f\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec6\u8282\u6316\u6398\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea698%\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D-VLM\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d3D-VLM\u76f4\u63a5\u5c063D\u70b9\u4e91\u5d4c\u5165\u52303D\u6807\u8bb0\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u5206\u5904\u7406\u6240\u67093D\u6807\u8bb0\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u5de8\u5927\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c113D\u6807\u8bb0\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u57fa\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u8865\u507f\u538b\u7f29(HCC-3D)\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29(GSC)\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u67e5\u8be2\u5c06\u6240\u67093D\u6807\u8bb0\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u5c11\u91cf\u5173\u952e\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec6\u8282\u6316\u6398(ADM)\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u8865\u8bc4\u5206\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u538b\u7f29\u663e\u8457\u4f46\u5173\u6ce8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u8865\u507fGSC\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eHCC-3D\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u76843D-VLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea698%\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "HCC-3D\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D-VLM\u4e2d3D\u6807\u8bb0\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Through analyzing decoding trajectories, we observe that most next-token predictions align well with the golden output, except for a few critical tokens that lead to deviations. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a novel Hint-Practice Reasoning (HPR) framework that operationalizes this insight through two synergistic components: 1) a hinter (powerful LLM) that provides probabilistic guidance at critical decision points, and 2) a practitioner (efficient smaller model) that executes major reasoning steps. The framework's core innovation lies in Distributional Inconsistency Reduction (DIR), a theoretically-grounded metric that dynamically identifies intervention points by quantifying the divergence between practitioner's reasoning trajectory and hinter's expected distribution in a tree-structured probabilistic space. Through iterative tree updates guided by DIR, HPR reweights promising reasoning paths while deprioritizing low-probability branches. Experiments across arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate HPR's state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs: it achieves comparable performance to self-consistency and MCTS baselines while decoding only 1/5 tokens, and outperforms existing methods by at most 5.1% absolute accuracy while maintaining similar or lower FLOPs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HPR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5927LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\u5668\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\uff0c\u5229\u7528DIR\u6307\u6807\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5e72\u9884\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7a77\u4e3e\u91c7\u6837\u4ea7\u751f prohibitive \u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u90e8\u5206token\u9884\u6d4b\u90fd\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u6570\u5173\u952etoken\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u79bb\u3002", "method": "HPR\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) hinter\uff08\u5f3a\u5927LLM\uff09\u5728\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b2) practitioner\uff08\u9ad8\u6548\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u6267\u884c\u4e3b\u8981\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u662fDIR\uff08Distributional Inconsistency Reduction\uff09\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u91cf\u5316\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u8005\u671f\u671b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5206\u6b67\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5e72\u9884\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHPR\u53ea\u89e3\u78011/5\u7684token\u5c31\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0eself-consistency\u548cMCTS\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u6216\u66f4\u4f4eFLOPs\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u9ad85.1%\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "HPR\u901a\u8fc7DIR\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6811\u66f4\u65b0\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u5206\u652f\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6548\u7387-\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities. We suggest that future multimodal LLMs should place greater emphasis on improving chart understanding to better support scientific claim verification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u5f62\u6210\u9c9c\u660e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u534f\u52a9\u5ba1\u7a3f\u4eba\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u8868\u683c\u6216\u56fe\u8868\u683c\u5f0f\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u8de8\u683c\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8c03\u6574\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u79d1\u5b66\u8bba\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8612\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u4f7f\u7528\u8868\u683c\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc1\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u8868\u683c\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u56f0\u96be\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u683c\u5f0f\u4e0a\u90fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u52b2\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u8f83\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b(8B\u4ee5\u4e0b)\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f31\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u6709\u9650\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u66f4\u52a0\u91cd\u89c6\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u652f\u6301\u79d1\u5b66\u58f0\u660e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned. Experiments on chest X-ray and carotid ultrasound datasets demonstrate that RadFlow consistently improves diagnostic coherence and overall report quality compared with state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "RadFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u62a5\u544a\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u533b\u7597\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u62a5\u544a\u89c6\u4e3a\u6241\u5e73\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u63cf\u8ff0\u53d1\u73b0\u2192\u603b\u7ed3\u5370\u8c61\u2192\u5173\u952e\u6848\u4f8b\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u5185\u5bb9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRadFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u5206\u5c42\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u4f18\u5316\uff1b2) \u4e34\u5e8a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5c42\u6b21\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u9762\u6574\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u5370\u8c61\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u5c42\u9762\u5f3a\u8c03\u5370\u8c61\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\uff1b3) \u5173\u952e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6848\u4f8b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u548c\u9888\u52a8\u8109\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cRadFlow\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u62a5\u544a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "RadFlow\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u62a5\u544a\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u65e2\u5177\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53c8\u7b26\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002"}}

However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%).

A compact convolutional policy is embedded in a differentiable PyTorch reaction--diffusion simulator, producing spatially smooth, bounded modulations of the feed and kill parameters ($\u0394F$, $\u0394K$) under a warm--hold--decay gain schedule. Training optimizes Turing-band spectral targets (FFT-based) while penalizing control effort ($\\ell_1/\\ell_2$) and instability. We compare three regimes: pure reaction--diffusion, NN-dominant, and a hybrid coupling. The hybrid achieves reliable, fast formation of target textures: 100% strict convergence in $\\sim 165$ steps, matching cell-only spectral selectivity (0.436 vs.\\ 0.434) while using $\\sim 15\\times$ less $\\ell_1$ effort and $>200\\times$ less $\\ell_2$ power than NN-dominant control. An amplitude sweep reveals a non-monotonic Goldilocks'' zone ($A \\approx 0.03$--$0.045$) that yields 100\\% quasi convergence in 94--96 steps, whereas weaker or stronger gains fail to converge or degrade selectivity.

However, analyzing the intricate reasoning processes within these interactions presents a significant challenge due to complex contextual dependencies and a lack of specialized visualization tools, leading to a high cognitive load for researchers. To address this gap, we present VISTA, an web-based Visual Interactive System for Textual Analytics in multi-turn reasoning tasks. VISTA allows users to visualize the influence of context on model decisions and interactively modify conversation histories to conduct \"what-if\" analyses across different models. Furthermore, the platform can automatically parse a session and generate a reasoning dependency tree, offering a transparent view of the model's step-by-step logical path.

However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected. We conduct a systematic exploration to assess the impact of protecting each path independently and find that joint protection is essential for effective defense. Based on this, we propose RAGFort, a structure-aware dual-module defense combining \"contrastive reindexing\" for inter-class isolation and \"constrained cascade generation\" for intra-class protection.

To address this, we propose Text2SQL-Flow, a SQL-aware data augmentation framework that generates large-scale, semantically valid, and structurally diverse Text-to-SQL pairs from minimal seed data. It operates across six augmentation dimensions and integrates an end-to-end pipeline featuring SQL execution verification, natural language question generation, chain-of-thought reasoning traces, and data classification. A modular Database Manager ensures cross-database compatibility and scalability. Using this framework, we build SQLFlow, a high-quality dataset of 89,544 annotated examples. We evaluate SQLFlow in two settings: (1) For open-source LLMs, fine-tuning on SQLFlow consistently improves performance across benchmarks under the same data budget. (2) For closed-source LLMs, we introduce a masked alignment retrieval method that treats SQLFlow as both knowledge base and training data for the retriever.

However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art defenses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53bb\u504f\u53cc\u4e0d\u53d8\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u53cc\u5bf9\u6297\u81ea\u5143\u9632\u5fa1\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u662f\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528(\u5982\u884c\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a)\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60ReID\u6a21\u578b\u6781\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5bf9\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u5982ReID\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709ReID\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2ReID\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u590d\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53bb\u504f\u53cc\u4e0d\u53d8\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5305\u542b\uff1a(1)\u6570\u636e\u5e73\u8861\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b(2)\u53cc\u5bf9\u6297\u81ea\u5143\u9632\u5fa1\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u8fdc\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u6269\u5c55\u8f6f\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u5143\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u7a81\u7834\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u884c\u4ebaReID\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6297\u9632\u5fa1\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u53cc\u4e0d\u53d8\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u590d\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art. DenoGrad outperforms existing denoising strategies, enhancing the performance of interpretable IA models while standing out as the only high quality approach that preserves the original data distribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "DenoGrad\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u53bb\u566a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u548c\u6709\u504f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u5f0f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6a21\u578b\u5c24\u5176\u4e0d\u5229\u3002\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e94\u8be5\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u800c\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDenoGrad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cDenoGrad\u52a8\u6001\u6821\u6b63\u566a\u58f0\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cDenoGrad\u5728\u8868\u683c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u53bb\u566a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DenoGrad\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To enable step-by-step evaluation, we construct verified CoT annotations for CommonsenseQA and LogiQA via a pipeline that enforces standardized reasoning structures, comprehensive option-wise analysis, and human verification. We evaluate 7 methods across 6 open-source LLMs (1B-70B) on 4 datasets spanning mathematics, commonsense, and logic, and propose the E3-Score, a principled metric inspired by economic trade-off modeling that provides smooth, stable evaluation without discontinuities or heavy reliance on heuristics. Experiments show that no single method universally dominates; optimal strategies depend on backbone scale, task complexity, and architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EffiReason-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u548cE3-Score\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u67b6\u6784", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u957f\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7387\u5bfc\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u51c6", "method": "\u6784\u5efaEffiReason-Bench\u7edf\u4e00\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u7c7b\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7684CoT\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6743\u8861\u5efa\u6a21\u7684E3-Score\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u57286\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f307\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u666e\u904d\u5360\u4f18\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u67b6\u6784\uff1bE3-Score\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e73\u6ed1\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u9700\u8981\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u591a\u4e2a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981"}}

A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition. Our results demonstrate that our methods are efficient and produce planning specifications that are orders of magnitude more succinct than the ones produced by compilers that ground the domain, while remaining competitive when used for planning with a state-of-the-art planner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u57fa\u7840\u5316\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21PDDL\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u9ad8\u5143\u6570\u52a8\u4f5c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65e0\u57fa\u7840\u5316\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u56fd\u9645\u89c4\u5212\u7ade\u8d5b\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u5316\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u89c4\u7ea6\u7b80\u6d01\u6570\u500d\u7684\u89c4\u683c\u8bf4\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u57fa\u7840\u5316\u7f16\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains. Together, we hope our work offers a new perspective on data utility in multilingual contexts and support the development of more linguistically informed LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLangGPS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u5408\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u867d\u7136\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6216\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "LangGPS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff08\u8861\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u6837\u672c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff09\u8fc7\u6ee4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u70bc\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u8fb9\u754c\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u5bfc\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u57286\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c22\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLangGPS\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6548\u679c\u660e\u663e\u3002\u9ad8\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u6837\u672c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f62\u6210\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u8fb9\u754c\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4f4e\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u6837\u672c\u5219\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6865\u6881\u3002\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u8fd8\u53ef\u6307\u5bfc\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u6837\u672c\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5177\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity.

Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \\textit{M}ultimodal framework, \\textit{MTP}, for urban \\textit{T}raffic \\textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities.

However, their detection latency and tendency to hallucinate predictions render them unsuitable for direct deployment. This work introduces a novel pipeline that addresses this challenge by leveraging VLMs to automatically generate pseudo-labels for training efficient, real-time object detectors. Our key innovation is a per-object co-teaching-based training strategy that mitigates the inherent noise in VLM-generated labels. The proposed per-object coteaching approach filters noisy bounding boxes from training instead of filtering the entire image. Specifically, two YOLO models learn collaboratively, filtering out unreliable boxes from each mini-batch based on their peers' per-object loss values. Overall, our pipeline provides an efficient, robust, and scalable approach to train high-performance object detectors for autonomous driving, significantly reducing reliance on costly human annotation.

Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEvoReal\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4ece\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cVRP\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728TSPLib\u548cCVRPLib\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u5c06\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u5206\u522b\u964d\u81f31.05%\u548c2.71%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u867d\u7136\u5728\u5408\u6210\u8def\u7531\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cVRP\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5305\u62ecTSPLib\u548cCVRPLib\u7b49\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8ba4\u53ef\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fdb\u5316\u73b0\u5b9e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5408\u6210(EvoReal)\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3NCO\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u2014\u2014\u5148\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\u8fdb\u884c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eEvoReal\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728TSPLib\u548cCVRPLib\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8de8\u5e7f\u6cdb\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u81f31.05%\u548c2.71%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u5316\u5408\u6210\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0cEvoReal\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cVRP\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark.

Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question.

This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that DiVE effectively preserves the geometric structure, achieving strong results across ID, OOD, and zero-shot metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DiVE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3OOD\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u626d\u66f2\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiVE\uff08\u5dee\u5206\u5411\u91cf\u5747\u8861\u5316\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u540c\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u5411\u91cf\u635f\u5931(AVL)\u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u5411\u91cf\u635f\u5931(PVL)\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eDiVE\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "DiVE\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u626d\u66f2\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5206\u5411\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \\textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct.

While recent diffusion-based approaches have shown improvements in visual quality, key limitations remain: lack of support for low-resource languages, domain gap between synthetic and real data, and the absence of appropriate metrics for evaluating text style preservation. To address these challenges, we propose STELLAR (Scene Text Editor for Low-resource LAnguages and Real-world data). STELLAR enables reliable multilingual editing through a language-adaptive glyph encoder and a multi-stage training strategy that first pre-trains on synthetic data and then fine-tunes on real images. We also construct a new dataset, STIPLAR(Scene Text Image Pairs of Low-resource lAnguages and Real-world data), for training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose Text Appearance Similarity (TAS), a novel metric that assesses style preservation by independently measuring font, color, and background similarity, enabling robust evaluation even without ground truth.

Heuristic search is a standard approach for solving such problems, relying on a heuristic function to estimate the cost to the goal from any given state.

These methods typically rely on single-step Bellman updates, where the heuristic of a state is updated based on its best neighbor and the corresponding edge cost.

This is particularly beneficial in low-resource language settings where the benefits of recent LLMs have been unevenly distributed across languages. In this work, we present a systematic study on the generation and evaluation of synthetic multilingual pretraining data for Indic languages, where we construct a large-scale synthetic dataset BhashaKritika, comprising 540B tokens using 5 different techniques for 10 languages. We explore the impact of grounding generation in documents, personas, and topics. We analyze how language choice, both in the prompt instructions and document grounding, affects data quality, and we compare translations of English content with native generation in Indic languages. To support scalable and language-sensitive evaluation, we introduce a modular quality evaluation pipeline that integrates script and language detection, metadata consistency checks, n-gram repetition analysis, and perplexity-based filtering using KenLM models.

However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%.

This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies. ATR4CH provides a replicable framework adaptable across CH domains and institutional resources. Research Limitations - The produced KG is limited to Wikipedia articles. While the results are encouraging, human oversight is necessary during post-processing.

Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

We propose this primar- ily stems from spurious correlations arising when models strongly associate highly co-occurring objects during train- ing, leading to hallucinated objects influenced by visual con- text. Current benchmarks mainly focus on hallucination de- tection but lack a formal characterization and quantitative evaluation of spurious correlations in LVLMs. To address this, we introduce causal analysis into the object recognition scenario of LVLMs, establishing a Structural Causal Model (SCM). Utilizing the language of causality, we formally de- fine spurious correlations arising from co-occurrence bias.

As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses. Extensive experiments reveal that TruthfulRAG outperforms existing methods, effectively alleviating knowledge conflicts and improving the robustness and trustworthiness of RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "TruthfulRAG\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u89e3\u51b3RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u71b5\u503c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0eLLMs\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u788e\u7247\u5316\u548c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u5dee\u3002", "method": "TruthfulRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u4ece\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6784\u5efa\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u503c\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51b2\u7a81\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7fLLMs\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u5fe0\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u56de\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTruthfulRAG\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "TruthfulRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6280\u672f\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8bcd\u6c47/\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u9762\u51b2\u7a81\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ea7\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively.

While most previous work has concentrated on optimal search methods, this paper focuses on bounded-suboptimal bidirectional search, where a bound on the suboptimality of the solution cost is specified. We build upon the state-of-the-art optimal bidirectional search algorithm, BAE*, designed for consistent heuristics, and introduce several variants of BAE* specifically tailored for the bounded-suboptimal context.

Such studies include evaluations of base LLMs (pre-trained on unlabeled corpora only) for this purpose. Our position paper argues that evaluating base LLMs' reasoning capabilities raises inherent methodological concerns that are overlooked in such existing studies. We highlight the fundamental mismatch between base LLMs' pretraining objective and normative qualities, such as correctness, by which reasoning is assessed. In particular, we show how base LLMs generate logically valid or invalid conclusions as coincidental byproducts of conforming to purely linguistic patterns of statistical plausibility. This fundamental mismatch challenges the assumptions that (a) base LLMs' outputs can be assessed as their bona fide attempts at correct answers or conclusions; and (b) conclusions about base LLMs' reasoning can generalize to post-trained LLMs optimized for successful instruction-following.

Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions. Evaluated on the SceneFun3D dataset, AffordBot achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea63D\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u548cAffordBot\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u57283D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f74\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4ec5\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u96f6\u6563\u5904\u7406\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "AffordBot\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6e32\u67d3\u73af\u7ed5\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u5c063D\u5143\u7d20\u5019\u9009\u6295\u5f71\u52302D\u89c6\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728SceneFun3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75283D\u70b9\u4e91\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c31\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u6865\u63a5\u4e863D\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e2D\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b-\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios.

We propose a formal framework to audit privacy leakage using abductive explanations, which identifies minimal sufficient evidence justifying model decisions and determines whether sensitive information disclosed. Our framework formalizes both individual and system-level leakage, introducing the notion of Potentially Applicable Explanations (PAE) to identify individuals whose outcomes can shield those with sensitive features. This approach provides rigorous privacy guarantees while producing human understandable explanations, a key requirement for auditing tools. Experimental evaluation on the German Credit Dataset illustrates how the importance of sensitive literal in the model decision process affects privacy leakage.

However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\\% mAP, +0.8\\% NDS, and +1.3\\% average recall on nuScenes.

Using two parallelized levels and shared information among workers, we present the first massively parallel version of Proof-Number Search that scales efficiently even on a large number of CPUs.

Prevailing methods based on signed distance fields (SDFs) are hampered by costly watertight preprocessing and struggle with non-manifold geometries, while point-cloud representations often suffer from sampling artifacts and surface discontinuities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) framework built upon unsigned distance fields (UDFs)-a more robust and computationally efficient representation that naturally handles complex and incomplete shapes. Our core innovation is a local-to-global (LoG) architecture that processes the UDF by partitioning it into uniform subvolumes, termed UBlocks. This architecture couples 3D convolutions for capturing local detail with sparse transformers for enforcing global coherence. A Pad-Average strategy further ensures smooth transitions at subvolume boundaries during reconstruction. This modular design enables seamless scaling to ultra-high resolutions up to 2048^3-a regime previously unattainable for 3D VAEs.

With the goal of auto-formalizing mathematical results at the research level, we develop a framework for structure-to-instance theorem autoformalization (SITA), which systematically bridges the gap between abstract mathematical theories and their concrete applications in Lean proof assistant. Formalized abstract structures are treated as modular templates that contain definitions, assumptions, operations, and theorems. These templates serve as reusable guides for the formalization of concrete instances.

The proposed approach employs a novel multimodal frequency domain attention (MFDA) to mine complementary information between modalities and a frequency domain feed-forward layer (FDFFL) via a mixed-scale frequency feature fusion strategy is designed to better enhance multimodal features. To eliminate the imbalance of multimodal information, a cross-modal global modeling module (CGMM) is constructed to perform pixel-wise inter-modal feature interaction in a spatial and channel manner. Moreover, a local feature enhancement module (LFEM) is developed to strengthen multimodal local feature representation and promote multimodal feature fusion by using various convolution layers and applying a channel shuffle.

These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions. Our results offer a general theory of analogical inference across discrete and continuous domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b9e\u503c\u57df\u7c7b\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u57df\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4fdd\u6301\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7c7b\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e03\u5c14\u57df\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u8fde\u7eed\u57df\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u5904\u7406\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u57df\u7684\u7c7b\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4f8b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\u7684\u5931\u6548\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u5747\u503c\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7c7b\u6bd4\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b9e\u503c\u57df\u7c7b\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u5e03\u5c14\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u5728\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5e03\u5c14\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7c7b\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u7c7b\u6bd4\u4fdd\u6301\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\uff1b\u5728\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u57df\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u5e73\u5747\u60c5\u51b5\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7c7b\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6db5\u76d6\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u57df\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO.

Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning.

A recently proposed method for this is to compute a sequence of explanation steps. Such a step-wise explanation shows individual reasoning steps involving constraints from the original specification, that in the end explain a conflict. However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step. More specifically, we define a framework of abstract proofs, in which both proofs and step-wise explanations can be represented. We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small.

To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation.

We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.\n  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates.

Using this dataset, we present GaussMedAct, a multivariate Gaussian encoding framework, to advance medical motion analysis through adaptive spatiotemporal representation learning.

Hybrid Spatial Encoding, employing a Cartesian and Vector dual-stream strategy, effectively utilizes skeletal information in the form of joint and bone features.

We define its syntax and semantics and analyze its computational complexity, obtaining the result that S4F Standpoint Logic is not computationally harder than its constituent logics, whether in monotonic or non-monotonic form. We also outline mechanisms for credulous and sceptical acceptance and illustrate the framework with an example.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aS4F\u7acb\u573a\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06S4F\u6a21\u6001\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u7acb\u573a\u547d\u9898\u903b\u8f91\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u8fbe\u591a\u89c2\u70b9\u3001\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u627f\u8bfa\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0d\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5176\u7ec4\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u7acb\u573a\u903b\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u903b\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8868\u793a\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bb8\u591a\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u903b\u8f91\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fS4F\uff09\u81ea\u7136\u6355\u83b7\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u89c2\u70b9\u548c\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86S4F\u7acb\u573a\u903b\u8f91\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86S4F\u548c\u7acb\u573a\u547d\u9898\u903b\u8f91\uff1b\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5176\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u8f7b\u4fe1\u548c\u6000\u7591\u63a5\u53d7\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "S4F\u7acb\u573a\u903b\u8f91\u5728\u5355\u8c03\u6216\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u90fd\u4e0d\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5176\u7ec4\u6210\u903b\u8f91\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u8868\u8fbe\u591a\u89c2\u70b9\u3001\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u8bed\u4e49\u627f\u8bfa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "S4F\u7acb\u573a\u903b\u8f91\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u89c2\u70b9\u548c\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5408\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b75,336\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u6839\u672c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0eRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6db5\u76d6\u7528\u6237\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3001\u52a9\u624b\u56de\u5fc6\u3001\u504f\u597d\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0875,336\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u7b80\u5355\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u590d\u6742RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982Mem0\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u7b80\u5355\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6d88\u606f\u8bc1\u636e\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523070-82%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u590d\u6742RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec530-45%\uff1b\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5728\u524d30\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5728150\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u524d\u4ecd\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u540e\u9700\u6df7\u5408\u6216RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5c0f\u8bed\u6599\u4f18\u52bf\uff08\u53ef\u7a77\u4e3e\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff09\u503c\u5f97\u4e13\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u56e0\u5176\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u3001\u9010\u6b65\u589e\u957f\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u91c7\u7528\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8f6c\u6362\u70b9\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u5e94\u7b80\u5355\u5c06\u901a\u7528RAG\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u9488\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u4f18\u52bf\u5f00\u5c55\u4e13\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization.

While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction.

Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that VLF-MSC outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.", "AI": {"tldr": "VLF-MSC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u8f93\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81(VLF)\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u6280\u672f\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "VLF-MSC\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLM)\u5c06\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81(VLF)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u4f20\u8f93\u3002\u63a5\u6536\u7aef\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u57fa\u4e8eVLF\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eVLF-MSC\u5728\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u548c\u7eaf\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5e26\u5bbd\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4fe1\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "VLF-MSC\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u6d41\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9891\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%.

This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns. These constraints jointly regularize the global diffusion process and reinforce structural awareness. Extensive evaluations on standard co-speech benchmarks show that GlobalDiff generates smooth and accurate motions, improving the performance by 46.0 % compared to the current SOTA under multiple speaker identities.", "AI": {"tldr": "GlobalDiff\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u534f\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6848\u89e3\u51b3\u5c42\u7ea7\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534746.0%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u97f3\u534f\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u9aa8\u67b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGlobalDiff\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5173\u8282\u65cb\u8f6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u89e3\u8026\u5404\u5173\u8282\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4e0a\u6e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7ea7\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u951a\u70b9\u6355\u83b7\u7cbe\u7ec6\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u9aa8\u67b6\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5236\u9aa8\u9abc\u95f4\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5206\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u8bed\u97f3\u534f\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGlobalDiff\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534746.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u65cb\u8f6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\uff0cGlobalDiff\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c42\u7ea7\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u534f\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to (\"where to look\") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail (\"what to select\"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing \"what to select\", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider \"where to look\", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a \"guide-globally, select-locally\" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures.

This paper details our team submission to the MEDIQA-OE-2025 Shared Task. We investigate the performance of MedGemma, a new domain-specific open-source language model, for structured order extraction. We systematically evaluate three distinct prompting paradigms: a straightforward one-Shot approach, a reasoning-focused ReAct framework, and a multi-step agentic workflow. Our experiments reveal that while more complex frameworks like ReAct and agentic flows are powerful, the simpler one-shot prompting method achieved the highest performance on the official validation set. We posit that on manually annotated transcripts, complex reasoning chains can lead to \"overthinking\" and introduce noise, making a direct approach more robust and efficient.

In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description. However, when treating LLM as a recognizer, two questions arise: 1) How can LLMs understand skeleton? 2) How can LLMs distinguish among actions? To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences. Experiments on several skeleton-based action classification benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our SUGAR.

The main goal of RG is to be both computationally efficient and convenient for game design. The system consists of several languages. The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language. RG generates faster forward models than the current state of the art, beating other GGP systems (Regular Boardgames, Ludii) in terms of efficiency.

The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality.

The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language entropy is currently computationally infeasible. We introduce encoder-augmented causal decoder model architectures that exhibit superior training efficiency characteristics and achieve higher compression than causal transformers even when trained on modest hardware. We demonstrate how entropy estimates can be obtained on a per-token basis, and show that the generalization of models trained to approach the entropy of their training data necessarily exceeds the generalization of models trained to minimize loss beyond this value. We show empirically that causal models trained to approach but not exceed estimated per-token entropies exhibit greater generalization than models trained without taking entropy into account.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose RobIA, a novel Robust, Instance-Aware framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) in stereo depth estimation. RobIA integrates two key components: (1) Attend-and-Excite Mixture-of-Experts (AttEx-MoE), a parameter-efficient module that dynamically routes input to frozen experts via lightweight self-attention mechanism tailored to epipolar geometry, and (2) Robust AdaptBN Teacher, a PEFT-based teacher model that provides dense pseudo-supervision by complementing sparse handcrafted labels. This strategy enables input-specific flexibility, broad supervision coverage, improving generalization under domain shift.

Recent methods primarily focus on leveraging additional prior knowledge and advanced multi-task architectures to achieve competitive performance. However, these pipelines rely on implicit modeling that uses frame-level or fragmented video features, failing to capture the temporal coherence across event sequences and comprehensive semantics within visual contexts. To address this, we propose an explicit temporal-semantic modeling framework called Context-Aware Cross-Modal Interaction (CACMI), which leverages both latent temporal characteristics within videos and linguistic semantics from text corpus. Specifically, our model consists of two core components: Cross-modal Frame Aggregation aggregates relevant frames to extract temporally coherent, event-aligned textual features through cross-modal retrieval; and Context-aware Feature Enhancement utilizes query-guided attention to integrate visual dynamics with pseudo-event semantics.

This survey investigates this breakdown across three core primitives-negation, counting, and spatial relations. Our analysis reveals a dramatic performance collapse: models that are accurate on single primitives fail precipitously when these are combined, exposing severe interference. We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations. Second, continuous attention architectures are fundamentally unsuitable for discrete logic. Third, evaluation metrics reward visual plausibility over constraint satisfaction. By analyzing recent benchmarks and methods, we show that current solutions and simple scaling cannot bridge this gap.

Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime.

Biases in detection models toward different demographic groups, such as gender and race, may lead to systemic misjudgments, exacerbating the digital divide and social inequities. However, current fairness-enhanced detectors often improve fairness at the cost of detection accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-mechanism collaborative optimization framework. Our proposed method innovatively integrates structural fairness decoupling and global distribution alignment: decoupling channels sensitive to demographic groups at the model architectural level, and subsequently reducing the distance between the overall sample distribution and the distributions corresponding to each demographic group at the feature level. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with other methods, our framework improves both inter-group and intra-group fairness while maintaining overall detection accuracy across domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u673a\u5236\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4fe1\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u6027\u522b\u548c\u79cd\u65cf\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bef\u5224\uff0c\u52a0\u5267\u6570\u5b57\u9e3f\u6c9f\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5f80\u5f80\u4ee5\u727a\u7272\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u673a\u5236\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1a\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5c42\u9762\u89e3\u8026\u5bf9\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u654f\u611f\u7684\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u9762\u51cf\u5c11\u6574\u4f53\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5404\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u5bf9\u5e94\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u6574\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ec4\u95f4\u548c\u7ec4\u5185\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u673a\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8eab\u4efd\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although many TIPR methods have achieved promising results, sometimes textual queries cannot accurately and comprehensively reflect the content of the image, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and overfitting to limited datasets. Moreover, the inherent modality gap between text and image further amplifies these issues, making accurate cross-modal retrieval even more challenging. To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective. GEA contains two parallel modules: (1) Text-Guided Token Enhancement (TGTE), which introduces diffusion-generated images as intermediate semantic representations to bridge the gap between text and visual patterns. These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment. (2) Generative Intermediate Fusion (GIF), which combines cross-attention between generated images, original images, and text features to generate a unified representation optimized by triplet alignment loss. We conduct extensive experiments on three public TIPR datasets, CUHK-PEDES, RSTPReid, and ICFG-PEDES, to evaluate the performance of GEA. The results justify the effectiveness of our method.

Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE.

However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential. These designs enable substantial performance improvement of the collaborative framework with minimal training cost. We evaluate our approach on the OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets.

However, such approaches that target generalization require pretraining over real samples. Additionally, these methods primarily focus on detecting audio-visual inconsistencies and may overlook intra-modal artifacts causing them to fail against manipulations that preserve audio-visual alignment. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage training framework that enhances generalization by incorporating next-frame prediction for both uni-modal and cross-modal features. Additionally, we introduce a window-level attention mechanism to capture discrepancies between predicted and actual frames, enabling the model to detect local artifacts around every frame, which is crucial for accurately classifying fully manipulated videos and effectively localizing deepfake segments in partially spoofed samples.

This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction.

Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability.

In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy. Then, we propose a stage-aware feature enhancement and fusion module to boost the perception of stage-specific key regions and enhance the robustness to visual changes caused by frequent camera viewpoints switching. In addition, we propose a knowledge-based grade-aware decoder to incorporate possible deduction items as prior knowledge to predict more accurate and reliable scores.

The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion.

Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories.

Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context.

However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training.

Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset.

While recent methods like CLIP-based semantic augmentation have shown promise, they often overlook the underlying structure of feature distributions and frequency-domain characteristics that are critical for robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances SDG object detection by integrating the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and Fourier transformation into a CLIP-guided pipeline. Specifically, we model the directional features of object representations using vMF to better capture domain-invariant semantic structures in the embedding space. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier-based augmentation strategy that perturbs amplitude and phase components to simulate domain shifts in the frequency domain, further improving feature robustness. Our method not only preserves the semantic alignment benefits of CLIP but also enriches feature diversity and structural consistency across domains.

Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning.

Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4e2a\u6027\u5316AI\u9690\u79c1\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff1a\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4e14\u6781\u6613\u88ab\u7b80\u5355\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u53bb\u9664\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u8eab\u4efd\u4ecd\u53ef\u88ab\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e2a\u6027\u5316AI\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982DreamBooth\uff09\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5b9a\u5236\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AntiDB_Purify\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7eaf\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7eaf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7eaf\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u79fb\u9664\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u80fd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u91cd\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e2a\u6027\u5316AI\u9690\u79c1\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u662f\u865a\u5047\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u611f\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u52a0\u9690\u853d\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u771f\u6b63\u4fdd\u969c\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u5b89\u5168\u3002"}}

Real-world environmental challenges such as background clutter, varying illumination, and occlusions pose significant obstacles to effective lane detection, particularly when relying on data-driven approaches that require substantial effort and cost for data collection and annotation. To address these issues, lane detection methods must leverage contextual and global information from surrounding lanes and objects. In this paper, we propose a Spatial Attention Mutual Information Regularization with a pre-trained model as an Oracle, called SAMIRO. SAMIRO enhances lane detection performance by transferring knowledge from a pretrained model while preserving domain-agnostic spatial information. Leveraging SAMIRO's plug-and-play characteristic, we integrate it into various state-of-the-art lane detection approaches and conduct extensive experiments on major benchmarks such as CULane, Tusimple, and LLAMAS. The results demonstrate that SAMIRO consistently improves performance across different models and datasets.

In this work, we propose a physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model for simultaneous estimation of key canopy parameters from Sentinel-2 data. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that require real satellite images for self-supevised training. Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties. We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data. Our method requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images, offering a cost-effective and self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring.

However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns.

This module converts YOLOMS detection results into structured textual representations enriched with both qualitative and quantitative attributes. A domain-tuned LLM then performs semantic reasoning to generate interpretable fault analyses and maintenance recommendations.

Clinical assessments further confirmed the effectiveness of both GT++ and 3DFETUS, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in plane estimation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GT++\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c3DFETUS\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5b9a\u4f4d3D\u80ce\u513f\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u9762\u90e8\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9762\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e38\u89c4\u80ce\u513f\u8d85\u58f0\u68c0\u67e5\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u6807\u51c6\u9762\u90e8\u5e73\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u80ce\u513f\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u53d8\u5f02\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u67e5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u957f\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u8bca\u65ad\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) GT++\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u4ece3D\u8d85\u58f0\u4f53\u79ef\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\u9762\u90e8\u5e73\u9762\uff1b2) 3DFETUS\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u53163D\u80ce\u513f\u8d85\u58f0\u4f53\u79ef\u4e2d\u7684\u5e73\u9762\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee4.13\u6beb\u7c73\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee7.93\u5ea6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86GT++\u548c3DFETUS\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u9762\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u80ce\u513f\u9762\u90e8\u8d85\u58f0\u68c0\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u51cf\u5c11\u68c0\u67e5\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

The dataset contains short (10~s) top-down and side-view video clips of individual rodents, labeled at clip level as normal activity or seizure. It includes 10,101 negative samples and 2,952 positive samples collected from 19 subjects. We describe the data curation, annotation protocol and preprocessing pipeline, and report baseline experiments using a transformer-based video classifier (TimeSformer). Experiments employ five-fold cross-validation with strict subject-wise partitioning to prevent data leakage (no subject appears in more than one fold). Results show that the TimeSformer architecture enables discrimination between seizure and normal activity with an average F1-score of 97%. The dataset and baseline code are publicly released to support reproducible research on non-invasive, video-based monitoring in preclinical epilepsy research.

Yet, digital pathology pipelines often rely on grid-based tiling that ignores tissue architecture. This introduces irrelevant information and limits interpretability. We introduce histology-informed tiling (HIT), which uses semantic segmentation to extract glands from whole slide images (WSIs) as biologically meaningful input patches for multiple-instance learning (MIL) and phenotyping. Trained on 137 samples from the ProMPT cohort, HIT achieved a gland-level Dice score of 0.83 +/- 0.17. By extracting 380,000 glands from 760 WSIs across ICGC-C and TCGA-PRAD cohorts, HIT improved MIL models AUCs by 10% for detecting copy number variation (CNVs) in genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) and MYC, and revealed 15 gland clusters, several of which were associated with cancer relapse, oncogenic mutations, and high Gleason. Therefore, HIT improved the accuracy and interpretability of MIL predictions, while streamlining computations by focussing on biologically meaningful structures during feature extraction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u5207\u7247\u65b9\u6cd5(HIT)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4ece\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u817a\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u7684\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u5207\u7247\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784(\u5982\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u4e2d\u7684\u817a\u4f53)\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u764c\u75c7\u5206\u7ea7\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u751f\u7269\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u5207\u7247(HIT)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6280\u672f\u4ece\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf(WSI)\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u817a\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u793a\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60(MIL)\u548c\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5728ProMPT\u961f\u5217\u7684137\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "HIT\u5728\u817a\u4f53\u6c34\u5e73\u8fbe\u52300.83\u00b10.17\u7684Dice\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u4eceICGC-C\u548cTCGA-PRAD\u961f\u5217\u7684760\u5f20WSI\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4e8638\u4e07\u4e2a\u817a\u4f53\uff1b\u5c06MIL\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u76ae-\u95f4\u8d28\u8f6c\u5316(EMT)\u548cMYC\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u56e0\u62f7\u8d1d\u6570\u53d8\u5f02\u7684AUC\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8610%\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8615\u4e2a\u817a\u4f53\u7c07\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0e\u764c\u75c7\u590d\u53d1\u3001\u81f4\u764c\u7a81\u53d8\u548c\u9ad8Gleason\u8bc4\u5206\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "HIT\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86MIL\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u67b6\u6784\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The software provides a unified implementation of SRGAN-style models that is easy to configure, extend, and apply to multispectral satellite data such as Sentinel-2. Instead of requiring users to modify model code, OpenSR-SRGAN exposes generators, discriminators, loss functions, and training schedules through concise configuration files, making it straightforward to switch between architectures, scale factors, and band setups. The framework is designed as a practical tool and benchmark implementation rather than a state-of-the-art model. It ships with ready-to-use configurations for common remote sensing scenarios, sensible default settings for adversarial training, and built-in hooks for logging, validation, and large-scene inference.

Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients. The PancAP model achieved the highest Dice score of 0.79 $\\pm$ 0.17 and lowest ASSD error of 1.94 $\\pm$ 2.63 mm (p$<$0.05).

Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input.

In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticVLA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8aOpenVLA 21.1%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e3\u500d\u548c2.7\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u611f\u77e5\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5373\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u5904\u7406\uff1b2\uff09\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u6d45\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u5efa\u7acb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u963b\u788d\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSemanticVLA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09SD-Pruner\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u89c6\u89c9\u526a\u679d\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684ID-Pruner\u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u5408\u7684SA-Pruner\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u4e30\u5bcc\u7279\u5f81\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94token\uff1b2\uff09SH-Fuser\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u5668\uff09\u878d\u5408SigLIP\u548cDINOv2\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u8865\u4e01\u548c\u7a00\u758ftoken\uff1b3\uff09SA-Coupler\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8026\u5408\u5668\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSemanticVLA\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5728LIBERO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSemanticVLA\u6bd4OpenVLA\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u51fa21.1%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e3.0\u500d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e2.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SemanticVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite considerable progress in 4D neural rendering, existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically or model scenes and backgrounds separately aim to introduce parametric human priors. However, these approaches either neglect distinct motion characteristics of various components in scene especially human, leading to incomplete reconstructions, or ignore the information exchange between the separately modeled components, resulting in spatial inconsistencies and visual artifacts at human-scene boundaries. To address this, we propose {\\bf Separate-then-Map} (StM) strategy that introduces a dedicated information mapping mechanism to bridge separately defined and optimized models.

To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models. The enhanced VLA model by OmniVGGT not only outperforms the vanilla point-cloud-based baseline on mainstream benchmarks, but also effectively leverages accessible auxiliary inputs to achieve consistent gains on robotic tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniVGGT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u578b3D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5982\u76f8\u673a\u5185\u53c2\u3001\u4f4d\u59ff\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728RGB-only\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u4ecd\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u4ec5\u5904\u7406RGB\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6613\u4e8e\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u76f8\u673a\u5185\u53c2\u3001\u4f4d\u59ff\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGeoAdapter\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u96f6\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5377\u79ef\u9010\u6b65\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u968f\u673a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u6001\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u76ee/\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7acb\u4f53\u5339\u914d\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u884c\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniVGGT\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u75283D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency. The proposed approach is tested on Sentinel-2 imagery in Alberta, Canada, in comparison with several advanced classification approaches, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher classification accuracy and finer details that the other state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5168\u5c40\u5c40\u90e8OBIA-Mamba (MSOM)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3aSentinel-2\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20\u4ee4\u724c\u3001\u53cc\u5206\u652fCNN-mamba\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "Sentinel-2\u57fa\u4e8e\u7684\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u548c\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6(LULC)\u5206\u7c7b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6570\u636e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MSOM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\uff1a1) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790(OBIA) Mamba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u50cf\u7d20\u4f5c\u4e3aMamba\u4ee4\u724c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b2) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u5168\u5c40\u5c40\u90e8\u53cc\u5206\u652fCNN-mamba\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u5c40\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5e73\u8861\u5c40\u90e8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u963f\u5c14\u4f2f\u5854\u7701\u7684Sentinel-2\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u51e0\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MSOM\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Sentinel-2 LULC\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408OBIA\u6280\u672f\u3001Mamba\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LUA closely matches the fidelity of native high-resolution generation while offering a practical and efficient path to scalable, high-fidelity image synthesis in modern diffusion pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Latent Upscaler Adapter (LUA)\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728VAE\u89e3\u7801\u6b65\u9aa4\u524d\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u56f0\u96be\uff1a\u76f4\u63a5\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91c7\u6837\u6162\u4e14\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u800c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u540e\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u989d\u5916\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1LUA\u4f5c\u4e3adrop-in\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u4eabSwin\u98ce\u683c\u9aa8\u5e72\u67b6\u6784\u914d\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u7684pixel-shuffle\u5934\u90e8\uff0c\u652f\u63012x\u548c4x\u653e\u5927\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u6dfb\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u6269\u6563\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4SR\u57fa\u51c6\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u4e0a\u653e\u5927\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd13\u500d\uff081024px\u751f\u6210\u4ec5\u589e\u52a00.42\u79d2 vs \u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4SR\u76841.87\u79d2\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u540cVAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e3a\u65b0\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u5934\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "LUA\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u6269\u6563\u7ba1\u9053\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7d27\u5bc6\u5339\u914d\u539f\u751f\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In the multiple-choice setting - a dominant format for multimodal reasoning benchmarks - the paradigm faces a significant yet often overlooked obstacle: unfaithful trajectories that guess the correct option after a faulty chain of thought receive the same reward as genuine reasoning, which is a flaw that cannot be ignored. We propose Self-Consistency Sampling (SCS) to correct this issue. For each question, SCS (i) introduces small visual perturbations and (ii) performs repeated truncation and resampling of an initial trajectory; agreement among the resulting trajectories yields a differentiable consistency score that down-weights unreliable traces during policy updates. Based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, plugging SCS into RLOO, GRPO, and REINFORCE++ series improves accuracy by up to 7.7 percentage points on six multimodal benchmarks with negligible extra computation. SCS also yields notable gains on both Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct and InternVL3-8B, offering a simple, general remedy for outcome-reward RL in MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u91c7\u6837(SCS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u5982\u679c\u5076\u7136\u731c\u5bf9\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u4f1a\u5f97\u5230\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\"\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\"\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u91c7\u6837(SCS)\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff1a(1)\u5f15\u5165\u5c0f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\uff1b(2)\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u590d\u622a\u65ad\u548c\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u8f68\u8ff9\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c06SCS\u96c6\u6210\u5230RLOO\u3001GRPO\u548cREINFORCE++\u7b49\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u57286\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe7.7\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u51e0\u4e4e\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff1b\u5728Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct\u548cInternVL3-8B\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "SCS\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5931\u8d25\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u867d\u7136\u5728\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u65b9\u9762\u53d1\u6325\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd(sim-to-real gap)\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6545\u969c\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5408\u6210\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5047\u8c61\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Scenic\u6982\u7387\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u793a\u62bd\u8c61\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6807\u8bb0\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\u573a\u666f\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u5339\u914d\u6307\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u573a\u666f\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u968f\u7740\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u62df\u5931\u8d25\u573a\u666f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}
