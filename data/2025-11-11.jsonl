While\nrecent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a\npromising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a\nvariety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich\nconceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they\nexhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as \"the\nphrase 'The' at the start of sentences\". In this work, we propose that this is\ndue to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are\ntrained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax,\nsemantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore\nthis linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors\nsuperficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but\nimportant aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and\ntends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more\nlocal. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders\n(T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent\nactivations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet\npowerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic\nfeatures in a self-supervised manner.

We further demonstrate Pareto frontiers over the\naccuracy-efficiency plane and argue for an evaluation paradigm shift: we should\nno longer treat tokens as \"free\" to multiply. OckBench provides a unified\nplatform for measuring, comparing, and guiding research in token-efficient\nreasoning. Our benchmarks are available at https://ockbench.github.io/ ."}

Recent methods have further improved LLM\nperformance in complex mathematical reasoning. However, when extending these\nmethods beyond the domain of mathematical reasoning to tasks involving complex\ndomain-specific knowledge, we observe a consistent failure of LLMs to generate\nnovel insights during the reflection stage. Instead of conducting genuine\ncognitive refinement, the model tends to mechanically reiterate earlier\nreasoning steps without introducing new information or perspectives, a\nphenomenon referred to as \"Echo Reflection\". We attribute this behavior to two\nkey defects: (1) Uncontrollable information flow during response generation,\nwhich allows premature intermediate thoughts to propagate unchecked and distort\nfinal decisions; (2) Insufficient exploration of internal knowledge during\nreflection, leading to repeating earlier findings rather than generating new\ncognitive insights. Building on these findings, we proposed a novel\nreinforcement learning method termed Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization\n(AEPO).

This thesis\nexplores the direction of enhancing agents' zero-shot systematic generalization\nabilities by granting RL agents reasoning behaviors that are found to help\nsystematic generalization in the human brain. Inspired by human conscious\nplanning behaviors, we first introduced a top-down attention mechanism, which\nallows a decision-time planning agent to dynamically focus its reasoning on the\nmost relevant aspects of the environmental state given its instantaneous\nintentions, a process we call \"spatial abstraction\". This approach\nsignificantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks.\nSubsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper\nframework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more\nmanageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts\nand efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent\nspatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a\ncommon failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative\nmodels to generate state targets during planning.

We introduce a\ndataset that evaluates LLMs on both factual knowledge of known mechanisms, and\ntheir ability to reason about them under novel situations, presented as\ncounterfactuals that the models are unlikely to have seen during training.\nUsing this dataset, we show that o4-mini outperforms the 4o, o3, and o3-mini\nmodels from OpenAI, and the recent small Qwen3-4B-thinking model closely\nmatches o4-mini's performance, even outperforming it in some cases. We\ndemonstrate that the open world setting for reasoning tasks, which requires the\nmodel to recall relevant knowledge, is more challenging than the closed world\nsetting where the needed factual knowledge is provided. We also show that\ncounterfactuals affecting internal links in the reasoning chain present a much\nharder task than those affecting a link from the drug mentioned in the prompt."}

Recent generative modeling approaches have\nattempted to capture progression by mapping images into a latent\nrepresentational space and then controlling and guiding the representations to\ngenerate follow-up images from a baseline image. However, existing approaches\nimpose constraints on distribution learning, leading to latent spaces with\nlimited controllability to generate follow-up images without explicit\nsupervision from subject-specific longitudinal images. In order to enable\ncontrolled movements in the latent representational space and generate\nprogression images from a baseline image in an unsupervised manner, we\nintroduce a conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework. The explicit\nencoding mechanism of image-diffusion auto-encoders forms a compact latent\nspace capturing high-level semantics, providing means to disentangle\ninformation relevant for progression. Our approach leverages this latent space\nto condition and apply controlled shifts to baseline representations for\ngenerating follow-up. Controllability is induced by restricting these shifts to\na subspace, thereby isolating progression-related factors from subject\nidentity-preserving components. The shifts are implicitly guided by correlating\nwith progression attributes, without requiring subject-specific longitudinal\nsupervision. We validate the generations through image quality metrics,\nvolumetric progression analysis, and downstream classification in Alzheimer's\ndisease datasets from two different sources and disease categories.

We\ncompare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with\nthose authored by human experts.

To address this issue, we propose the Reasoning\nProcess Tree Score (RPTS), a tree structure-based metric to assess reasoning\nprocesses. Specifically, we organize the reasoning steps into a reasoning tree\nand leverage its hierarchical information to assign weighted faithfulness\nscores to each reasoning step. By dynamically adjusting these weights, RPTS not\nonly evaluates the overall correctness of the reasoning, but also pinpoints\nwhere the model fails in the reasoning. To validate RPTS in real-world\nmultimodal scenarios, we construct a new benchmark, RPTS-Eval, comprising 374\nimages and 390 reasoning instances. Each instance includes reliable\nvisual-textual clues that serve as leaf nodes of the reasoning tree.\nFurthermore, we define three types of intermodal relationships to investigate\nhow intermodal interactions influence the reasoning process. We evaluated\nrepresentative LVLMs (e.g., GPT4o, Llava-Next), uncovering their limitations in\nmultimodal reasoning and highlighting the differences between open-source and\nclosed-source commercial LVLMs. We believe that this benchmark will contribute\nto the advancement of research in the field of multimodal reasoning."}

Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders\n(T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent\nactivations of high-level features over adjacent tokens.

However, rather than focusing\nsolely on calculating data quality scores to evaluate instruction data, there\nis a growing need to select high-quality data that maximally enhances the\nperformance of instruction tuning for a given LLM. In this paper, we propose\nthe Model Instruction Weakness Value (MIWV) as a novel metric to quantify the\nimportance of instruction data in enhancing model's capabilities. The MIWV\nmetric is derived from the discrepancies in the model's responses when using\nIn-Context Learning (ICL), helping identify the most beneficial data for\nenhancing instruction tuning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat selecting only the top 1\\% of data based on MIWV can outperform training\non the full dataset. Furthermore, this approach extends beyond existing\nresearch that focuses on data quality scoring for data selection, offering\nstrong empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our proposed method."}

Then, we propose the\nSpatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Block (SFMB), which can enhance Mamba in both\nspatial and frequency domains for comprehensive feature extraction. Finally, we\npropose the Dynamic Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB), which can be deployed across\ndifferent branches for dynamic feature fusion. Extensive experiments show that\nour method achieves better results than most state-of-the-art methods on six\nMMIF datasets.

To this end,\nwe design a two-view correspondence pruning network called LeCoT, which can\nnaturally leverage global context information at different stages.\nSpecifically, the core design of LeCoT is the Spatial-Channel Fusion\nTransformer block, a newly proposed component that efficiently utilizes both\nspatial and channel global context information among sparse correspondences. In\naddition, we integrate the proposed prediction block that utilizes\ncorrespondence features from intermediate stages to generate a probability set,\nwhich acts as guiding information for subsequent learning phases, allowing the\nnetwork to more effectively capture robust global context information. Notably,\nthis prediction block progressively refines the probability set, thereby\nmitigating the issue of information loss that is common in the traditional one.\nExtensive experiments prove that the proposed LeCoT outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in correspondence pruning, relative pose estimation,\nhomography estimation, visual localization, and $3$D~reconstruction tasks.

The neglected joint effects of the semantic binding in the prompts cause\nsignificant failures in current debiasing approaches. This work initiates a\npreliminary investigation on how bias manifests under semantic binding, where\ncontextual associations between objects and attributes influence generative\noutcomes.

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{StreamKV}, a\ntraining-free framework that seamlessly equips Video-LLMs with advanced KV\ncache retrieval and compression.

For KV cache compression, StreamKV\nintroduces a guidance prompt designed to capture the key semantic elements\nwithin each segment, ensuring only the most informative KV caches are retained\nfor answering questions.
