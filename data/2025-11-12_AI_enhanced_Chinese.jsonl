The emergence of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, has expanded this integration even further. Because of LLM versatility and ease of use through APIs, these larger models are often utilised even though smaller, custom models can be used instead. In this paper, LLMs and small discriminative models are integrated into a Mendix application to detect Covid-19 in chest X-rays. These discriminative models are also used to provide knowledge bases for LLMs to improve accuracy. This provides a benchmark study of 14 different model configurations for comparison of accuracy and environmental impact. The findings indicated that while smaller models reduced the carbon footprint of the application, the output was biased towards a positive diagnosis and the output probabilities were lacking confidence. Meanwhile, restricting LLMs to only give probabilistic output caused poor performance in both accuracy and carbon footprint, demonstrating the risk of using LLMs as a universal AI solution. While using the smaller LLM GPT-4.1-Nano reduced the carbon footprint by 94.2% compared to the larger models, this was still disproportionate to the discriminative models; the most efficient solution was the Covid-Net model. Although it had a larger carbon footprint than other small models, its carbon footprint was 99.9% less than when using GPT-4.5-Preview, whilst achieving an accuracy of 95.5%, the highest of all models examined. This paper contributes to knowledge by comparing generative and discriminative models in Covid-19 detection as well as highlighting the environmental risk of using generative tools for classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u68c0\u6d4bCOVID-19\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fCovid-Net\uff09\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5c06LLMs\u7528\u4f5c\u901a\u7528AI\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eLLMs\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548cAPI\u6613\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5c0f\u578b\u5b9a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728COVID-19\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u79d1\u5b66\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728Mendix\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u4e86LLMs\u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u4e2d\u7684COVID-19\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3aLLMs\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf914\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u4f46\u8f93\u51fa\u504f\u5411\u9633\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff1b\u9650\u5236LLMs\u4ec5\u7ed9\u51fa\u6982\u7387\u8f93\u51fa\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5747\u8f83\u5dee\u3002Covid-Net\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f9795.5%\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5176\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u6bd4GPT-4.5-Preview\u4f4e99.9%\u3002GPT-4.1-Nano\u76f8\u6bd4\u5927\u578bLLMs\u51cf\u5c1194.2%\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4e0d\u5982\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fCovid-Net\uff09\u4e3aCOVID-19\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u8b66\u793a\u4e0d\u5e94\u5c06LLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u901a\u7528AI\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

However, numerous technical reports indicate that purely rule-based reward RL frequently results in poor-quality reasoning chains or inconsistencies between reasoning processes and final answers, particularly when the base model is of smaller scale. During the RL exploration process, models might employ low-quality reasoning chains due to the lack of knowledge, occasionally producing correct answers randomly and receiving rewards based on established rule-based judges. This constrains the potential for resource-limited organizations to conduct direct reinforcement learning training on smaller-scale models. We propose a novel confidence-based reward model tailored for enhancing STEM reasoning capabilities. Unlike conventional approaches, our model penalizes not only incorrect answers but also low-confidence correct responses, thereby promoting more robust and logically consistent reasoning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through static evaluations, Best-of-N inference tests, and PPO-based RL training.

The results show that early-stage metadata integration enhances both retrieval and answer accuracy while also revealing persistent challenges for RAG systems, including hallucinations during generation and difficulties in handling temporal or multi-hop historical queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u53f0\u6e7e\u5386\u53f2\u6863\u6848\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u53f0\u6e7e\u5386\u53f2\u6863\u6848\u7684RAG\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7e41\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u70ed\u5170\u906e\u57ce\u6863\u6848\u548c\u53f0\u6e7e\u7701\u8bae\u4f1a\u516c\u62a5\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u96c6\u4e0a\u6784\u5efaRAG\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u65e9\u671f\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u65f6\u95f4/\u591a\u8df3\u5386\u53f2\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\u56f0\u96be\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "RAG\u5728\u53f0\u6e7e\u5386\u53f2\u6863\u6848\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

The framework operates in three stages: (1) transforming video content into fine-grained captions using a vision-language model, (2) constructing structured knowledge by organizing the captions into four semantic slots (action, object, context, environment), and (3) generating slot-wise explanations that reveal which semantic factors contribute most to the anomaly decision.

Unlike standard scientific reasoning or general creative generation, idea generation in science is a multi-objective and open-ended task, where the novelty of a contribution is as essential as its empirical soundness. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising generators of scientific ideas, capable of producing coherent and factual outputs with surprising intuition and acceptable reasoning, yet their creative capacity remains inconsistent and poorly understood. This survey provides a structured synthesis of methods for LLM-driven scientific ideation, examining how different approaches balance creativity with scientific soundness. We categorize existing methods into five complementary families: External knowledge augmentation, Prompt-based distributional steering, Inference-time scaling, Multi-agent collaboration, and Parameter-level adaptation. To interpret their contributions, we employ two complementary frameworks: Boden's taxonomy of Combinatorial, Exploratory and Transformational creativity to characterize the level of ideas each family expected to generate, and Rhodes' 4Ps framework-Person, Process, Press, and Product-to locate the aspect or source of creativity that each method emphasizes.

We introduce a new data fusion framework, termed the method of double moments (MoDM), which reconstructs molecular structures from two instances of the second-order moment of projection images obtained under distinct orientation distributions--one uniform, the other non-uniform and unknown. We prove that these moments generically uniquely determine the underlying structure, up to a global rotation and reflection, and we develop a convex-relaxation-based algorithm that achieves accurate recovery using only second-order statistics. Our results demonstrate the advantage of collecting and modeling multiple datasets under different experimental conditions, illustrating that leveraging dataset diversity can substantially enhance reconstruction quality in computational imaging tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u91cd\u77e9\u65b9\u6cd5(MoDM)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u5b9e\u4f8b\u91cd\u5efa\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51b7\u51bb\u7535\u955c\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b7\u51bb\u7535\u955c\u6280\u672f\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u91cd\u77e9\u65b9\u6cd5(MoDM)\uff0c\u4ece\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u5411\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5747\u5300\u4e14\u672a\u77e5\uff09\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u6765\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u51f8\u677e\u5f1b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u5b9e\u4f8b\u53ef\u4ee5\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u5e95\u5c42\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u9664\u5168\u5c40\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u5916\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4ec5\u4e8c\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u6062\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u53cc\u91cd\u77e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Current solutions, which have evolved from retrieval using semantic embeddings to more sophisticated structured knowledge graphs representations for improved sense-making and associativity, are tailored for fact-based retrieval and fail to build the space-time-anchored narrative representations required for tracking entities through episodic events. To bridge this gap, we propose the \\textbf{Generative Semantic Workspace} (GSW), a neuro-inspired generative memory framework that builds structured, interpretable representations of evolving situations, enabling LLMs to reason over evolving roles, actions, and spatiotemporal contexts. Our framework comprises an \\textit{Operator}, which maps incoming observations to intermediate semantic structures, and a \\textit{Reconciler}, which integrates these into a persistent workspace that enforces temporal, spatial, and logical coherence. On the Episodic Memory Benchmark (EpBench) \\cite{huet_episodic_2025} comprising corpora ranging from 100k to 1M tokens in length, GSW outperforms existing RAG based baselines by up to \\textbf{20\\%}. Furthermore, GSW is highly efficient, reducing query-time context tokens by \\textbf{51\\%} compared to the next most token-efficient baseline, reducing inference time costs considerably.

Some approaches adopt complex strategies to convert graphs into text sequences, resulting in significant token overhead and rendering them impractical for large-scale graphs. Others introduce additional modules to encode graphs into fixed-size token representations for LLMs. However, these methods typically require large-scale post-training on graph-text corpus and complex alignment procedures, yet often yield sub-optimal results due to poor modality alignment.

Modulo cameras address this by folding incident irradiance into a bounded range, yet require specialized unwrapping algorithms to reconstruct the underlying signal. Unlike HDR recovery, which extends dynamic range from conventional sampling, modulo recovery restores actual values from folded samples. Despite being introduced over a decade ago, progress in modulo image recovery has been slow, especially in the use of modern deep learning techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that standard HDR methods are unsuitable for modulo recovery. Transformers, however, can capture global dependencies and spatial-temporal relationships crucial for resolving folded video frames. Still, adapting existing Transformer architectures for modulo recovery demands novel techniques. To this end, we present Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (SSViT), the first deep learning framework for modulo video reconstruction. SSViT employs a token selection strategy to improve efficiency and concentrate on the most critical regions. Experiments confirm that SSViT produces high-quality reconstructions from 8-bit folded videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance in modulo video recovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSSViT\uff08\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u6570\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u9971\u548c\uff1b\u6a21\u6570\u76f8\u673a\u901a\u8fc7\u6298\u53e0\u5165\u5c04\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5c55\u5f00\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6a21\u6570\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u5df2\u63d0\u51fa\u5341\u4f59\u5e74\uff0c\u8fdb\u5c55\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\uff1b\u6807\u51c6HDR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u6570\u6062\u590d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\uff08SSViT\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Transformer\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6298\u53e0\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6700\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "SSViT\u80fd\u591f\u4ece8\u4f4d\u6298\u53e0\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u6570\u89c6\u9891\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6HDR\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u6a21\u6570\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u9896\u6280\u672f\u6765\u9002\u914d\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SSViT\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u6570\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We survey existing tool features and identify a gap in conflict resolution methods and AI integration. To address this, we propose a framework and implementation design for a novel AI-enhanced tool that assists in dispute investigation. The framework organises heterogeneous artefacts - submissions (code, text, media), communications (chat, email), coordination records (meeting logs, tasks), peer assessments, and contextual information - into three dimensions with nine benchmarks: Contribution, Interaction, and Role. Objective measures are normalised, aggregated per dimension, and paired with inequality measures (Gini index) to surface conflict markers. A Large Language Model (LLM) architecture performs validated and contextual analysis over these measures to generate interpretable and transparent advisory judgments.

C", "Srinivas Anumasa", "Dianbo Liu"], "title": "Laplacian Score Sharpening for Mitigating Hallucination in Diffusion Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Diffusion models, though successful, are known to suffer from hallucinations that create incoherent or unrealistic samples. Recent works have attributed this to the phenomenon of mode interpolation and score smoothening, but they lack a method to prevent their generation during sampling. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc adjustment to the score function during inference that leverages the Laplacian (or sharpness) of the score to reduce mode interpolation hallucination in unconditional diffusion models across 1D, 2D, and high-dimensional image data. We derive an efficient Laplacian approximation for higher dimensions using a finite-difference variant of the Hutchinson trace estimator. We show that this correction significantly reduces the rate of hallucinated samples across toy 1D/2D distributions and a high- dimensional image dataset.

This gap, driven by mutually reinforcing cognitive biases in both humans and artificial intelligence (AI) systems, threatens the defensibility of valuations and sustainability of investments in the sector.\n  This report describes a framework emerging from systematic qualitative assessment across 7 frontier-grade LLMs and 3 market-facing venture vignettes under time pressure. Detailed prompting specifying decision partnership and explicitly instructing avoidance of sycophancy, confabulation, solution drift, and nihilism achieved initial partnership state but failed to maintain it under operational pressure. Sustaining protective partnership state required an emergent 7-stage calibration sequence, built upon a 4-stage initialization process, within a 5-layer protection architecture enabling bias self-monitoring, human-AI adversarial challenge, partnership state verification, performance degradation detection, and stakeholder protection.\n  Three discoveries resulted: partnership state is achievable through ordered calibration but requires emergent maintenance protocols; reliability degrades when architectural drift and context exhaustion align; and dissolution discipline prevents costly pursuit of fundamentally wrong directions. Cross-model validation revealed systematic performance differences across LLM architectures.\n  This approach demonstrates that human-AI teams can achieve cognitive partnership capable of preventing avoidable regret in high-stakes decisions, addressing return-on-investment expectations that depend on AI systems supporting consequential decision-making without introducing preventable cognitive traps when verification arrives too late.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These methods typically improve a target output by intentionally degrading another, often the unconditional output, using heuristic perturbation functions such as identity mixing or blurred conditions. However, these approaches lack a principled foundation and rely on manually designed distortions. In this work, we propose Adversarial Sinkhorn Attention Guidance (ASAG), a novel method that reinterprets attention scores in diffusion models through the lens of optimal transport and intentionally disrupt the transport cost via Sinkhorn algorithm. Instead of naively corrupting the attention mechanism, ASAG injects an adversarial cost within self-attention layers to reduce pixel-wise similarity between queries and keys. This deliberate degradation weakens misleading attention alignments and leads to improved conditional and unconditional sample quality. ASAG shows consistent improvements in text-to-image diffusion, and enhances controllability and fidelity in downstream applications such as IP-Adapter and ControlNet.

Designed for scalable language understanding and robust instruction generalization under constrained compute budgets, Motif-2-12.7B builds upon Motif-2.6B with the integration of Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), which improves representational efficiency by disentangling signal and noise-control attention pathways. The model is pre-trained on 5.5 trillion tokens spanning diverse linguistic, mathematical, scientific, and programming domains using a curriculum-driven data scheduler that gradually changes the data composition ratio. The training system leverages the MuonClip optimizer alongside custom high-performance kernels, including fused PolyNorm activations and the Parallel Muon algorithm, yielding significant throughput and memory efficiency gains in large-scale distributed environments. Post-training employs a three-stage supervised fine-tuning pipeline that successively enhances general instruction adherence, compositional understanding, and linguistic precision.

It requires the integration of several capabilities, including multi-step reasoning, cross-document synthesis, and the generation of evidence-backed, long-form answers. Evaluating DR remains challenging because responses are lengthy and diverse, admit many valid solutions, and often depend on dynamic information sources. We introduce ResearchRubrics, a standardized benchmark for DR built with over 2,800+ hours of human labor that pairs realistic, domain-diverse prompts with 2,500+ expert-written, fine-grained rubrics to assess factual grounding, reasoning soundness, and clarity. We also propose a new complexity framework for categorizing DR tasks along three axes: conceptual breadth, logical nesting, and exploration. In addition, we develop human and model-based evaluation protocols that measure rubric adherence for DR agents. We evaluate several state-of-the-art DR systems and find that even leading agents like Gemini's DR and OpenAI's DR achieve under 68% average compliance with our rubrics, primarily due to missed implicit context and inadequate reasoning about retrieved information.

Meanwhile, efforts to interpret their internal mechanisms have emerged, offering insights to enhance multilingual performance. While multi-head self-attention (MHA) has proven critical in many areas, its role in multilingual capabilities remains underexplored. In this work, we study the contribution of MHA in supporting multilingual processing in LLMs. We propose Language Attention Head Importance Scores (LAHIS), an effective and efficient method that identifies attention head importance for multilingual capabilities via a single forward and backward pass through the LLM. Applying LAHIS to Aya-23-8B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B-v0.1, we reveal the existence of both language-specific and language-general heads. Language-specific heads enable cross-lingual attention transfer to guide the model toward target language contexts and mitigate off-target language generation issue, contributing to addressing challenges in multilingual LLMs. We also introduce a lightweight adaptation that learns a soft head mask to modulate attention outputs over language heads, requiring only 20 tunable parameters to improve XQuAD accuracy.

While several specialised toolkits provide high performance for specific tasks, using existing tools still requires substantial technical expertise. There remains a gap in accessible, integrated solutions that deliver sufficient tracking for non-experts across diverse settings.\n  TrackStudio was developed to address this gap by combining established open-source tools into a single, modular, GUI-based pipeline that works out of the box. It provides automatic 2D and 3D tracking, calibration, preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualisation without requiring any programming skills. We supply a user guide with practical advice for video acquisition, synchronisation, and setup, alongside documentation of common pitfalls and how to avoid them.\n  To validate the toolkit, we tested its performance across three environments using either low-cost webcams or high-resolution cameras, including challenging conditions for body position, lightning, and space and obstructions. Across 76 participants, average inter-frame correlations exceeded 0.98 and average triangulation errors remained low (<13.6mm for hand tracking), demonstrating stable and consistent tracking. We further show that the same pipeline can be extended beyond hand tracking to other body and face regions. TrackStudio provides a practical, accessible route into markerless tracking for researchers or laypeople who need reliable performance without specialist expertise.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although prior research explored scenario generation for military training, pre-LLM AI tools struggled to generate sufficiently complex or adaptable scenarios. This paper introduces a multi-agent, multi-modal reasoning framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate critical training artifacts, such as Operations Orders (OPORDs). We structure our framework by decomposing scenario generation into a hierarchy of subproblems, and for each one, defining the role of the AI tool: (1) generating options for a human author to select from, (2) producing a candidate product for human approval or modification, or (3) generating textual artifacts fully automatically. Our framework employs specialized LLM-based agents to address distinct subproblems. Each agent receives input from preceding subproblem agents, integrating both text-based scenario details and visual information (e.g., map features, unit positions and applies specialized reasoning to produce appropriate outputs. Subsequent agents process these outputs sequentially, preserving logical consistency and ensuring accurate document generation. This multi-agent strategy overcomes the limitations of basic prompting or single-agent approaches when tackling such highly complex tasks. We validate our framework through a proof-of-concept that generates the scheme of maneuver and movement section of an OPORD while estimating map positions and movements as a precursor demonstrating its feasibility and accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLM-driven multi-agent systems to generate coherent, nuanced documents and adapt dynamically to changing conditions, advancing automation in scenario generation for military training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u519b\u4e8b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5173\u952e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6587\u6863\uff08\u5982\u4f5c\u6218\u547d\u4ee4\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u521b\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u524dLLM\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684AI\u5de5\u5177\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u8db3\u591f\u590d\u6742\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7684\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u7531\u4e13\u95e8\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5904\u7406\u3002\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u4eba\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u9009\u9879\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u4ea7\u54c1\u4f9b\u6279\u51c6\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u6216\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5730\u56fe\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u5355\u4f4d\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\uff0c\u6309\u5e8f\u5904\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u4f5c\u6218\u547d\u4ee4\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5730\u56fe\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u4f30\u7b97\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u6587\u6863\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u519b\u4e8b\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

However, the inherent complexity of the algorithm, coupled with the high computational demands and latency incurred due to LLMs, raises concerns about its feasibility in real-time applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a focused study on pairwise reranking, demonstrating that carefully applied optimization methods can significantly mitigate these issues. By implementing these methods, we achieve a remarkable latency reduction of up to 166 times, from 61.36 seconds to 0.37 seconds per query, with an insignificant drop in performance measured by Recall@k. Our study highlights the importance of design choices that were previously overlooked, such as using smaller models, limiting the reranked set, using lower precision, reducing positional bias with one-directional order inference, and restricting output tokens.

While traditional lexicon-based tools like LIWC and Pattern have served as foundational instruments, Large Language Models (LLMs) promise enhanced context understanding. We evaluated three Dutch-specific LLMs (ChocoLlama-8B-Instruct, Reynaerde-7B-chat, and GEITje-7B-ultra) against LIWC and Pattern for valence prediction in Flemish, a low-resource language variant. Our dataset comprised approximately 25000 spontaneous textual responses from 102 Dutch-speaking participants, each providing narratives about their current experiences with self-assessed valence ratings (-50 to +50).

In this work, we systematically evaluate the reliability of six widely used reference-free factuality metrics, originally proposed for short-form summarization, in the long-document setting. We probe metric robustness through seven factuality-preserving perturbations applied to summaries, namely paraphrasing, simplification, synonym replacement, logically equivalent negations, vocabulary reduction, compression, and source text insertion, and further analyze their sensitivity to retrieval context and claim information density. Across three long-form benchmark datasets spanning science fiction, legal, and scientific domains, our results reveal that existing short-form metrics produce inconsistent scores for semantically equivalent summaries and exhibit declining reliability for information-dense claims whose content is semantically similar to many parts of the source document. While expanding the retrieval context improves stability in some domains, no metric consistently maintains factual alignment under long-context conditions. Finally, our results highlight concrete directions for improving factuality evaluation, including multi-span reasoning, context-aware calibration, and training on meaning-preserving variations to enhance robustness in long-form summarization.

We propose \\textbf{UltraGS}, a Gaussian Splatting framework optimized for ultrasound imaging. First, we introduce a depth-aware Gaussian splatting strategy, where each Gaussian is assigned a learnable field of view, enabling accurate depth prediction and precise structural representation. Second, we design SH-DARS, a lightweight rendering function combining low-order spherical harmonics with ultrasound-specific wave physics, including depth attenuation, reflection, and scattering, to model tissue intensity accurately.

Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate UltraGS's superiority, achieving state-of-the-art results in PSNR (up to 29.55), SSIM (up to 0.89), and MSE (as low as 0.002) while enabling real-time synthesis at 64.69 fps.

This is the extended preprint version including appendices", "summary": "Large language models now draft news, legal analyses, and software code with human-level fluency. At the same time, regulations such as the EU AI Act mandate that each synthetic passage carry an imperceptible, machine-verifiable mark for provenance. Conventional logit-based watermarks satisfy this requirement by selecting a pseudorandom green vocabulary at every decoding step and boosting its logits, yet the random split can exclude the highest-probability token and thus erode fluency. WaterMod mitigates this limitation through a probability-aware modular rule. The vocabulary is first sorted in descending model probability; the resulting ranks are then partitioned by the residue rank mod k, which distributes adjacent-and therefore semantically similar-tokens across different classes. A fixed bias of small magnitude is applied to one selected class. In the zero-bit setting (k=2), an entropy-adaptive gate selects either the even or the odd parity as the green list. Because the top two ranks fall into different parities, this choice embeds a detectable signal while guaranteeing that at least one high-probability token remains available for sampling. In the multi-bit regime (k>2), the current payload digit d selects the color class whose ranks satisfy rank mod k = d. Biasing the logits of that class embeds exactly one base-k digit per decoding step, thereby enabling fine-grained provenance tracing. The same modular arithmetic therefore supports both binary attribution and rich payloads. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMod consistently attains strong watermark detection performance while maintaining generation quality in both zero-bit and multi-bit settings. This robustness holds across a range of tasks, including natural language generation, mathematical reasoning, and code synthesis.

Unlike prior text- or layout-conditioned models, VectorSynth learns dense cross-modal correspondences that align imagery and semantic vector geometry, enabling fine-grained, spatially grounded edits. A vision language alignment module produces pixel-level embeddings from polygon semantics; these embeddings guide a conditional image generation framework to respect both spatial extents and semantic cues. VectorSynth supports interactive workflows that mix language prompts with geometry-aware conditioning, allowing rapid what-if simulations, spatial edits, and map-informed content generation. For training and evaluation, we assemble a collection of satellite scenes paired with pixel-registered polygon annotations spanning diverse urban scenes with both built and natural features. We observe strong improvements over prior methods in semantic fidelity and structural realism, and show that our trained vision language model demonstrates fine-grained spatial grounding.

Despite growing interest in brain-computer interface technologies, relatively little attention has been paid to developing EEG-based communication support systems tailored for aphasic patients. To address this gap, we recruited a single participant with expressive aphasia and conducted an Korean-based automatic speech task. EEG signals were recorded during task performance, and each trial was labeled as either correct or incorrect depending on whether the intended word was successfully spoken. Spectral analysis revealed distinct neural activation patterns between the two trial types: misarticulated trials exhibited excessive delta power across widespread channels and increased theta-alpha activity in frontal regions. Building upon these findings, we developed a soft multitask learning framework with maximum mean discrepancy regularization that focus on delta features to jointly optimize class discrimination while aligning the EEG feature distributions of correct and misarticulated trials. The proposed model achieved 58.6 % accuracy for correct and 45.5 % for misarticulated trials-outperforming the baseline by over 45 % on the latter-demonstrating robust intention decoding even under articulation errors.

The effects of the predictability of a word given its previous context are generally well-understood in both production and comprehension, but studies of naturalistic production have also revealed a poorly-understood backward predictability effect of a word given its future context, which may be related to future planning. Here, in two studies of naturalistic speech corpora, we investigate backward predictability effects using improved measures and more powerful language models, introducing a new principled and conceptually motivated information-theoretic predictability measure that integrates predictability from both the future and the past context. Our first study revisits classic predictability effects on word duration. Our second study investigates substitution errors within a generative framework that independently models the effects of lexical, contextual, and communicative factors on word choice, while predicting the actual words that surface as speech errors. We find that our proposed conceptually-motivated alternative to backward predictability yields qualitatively similar effects across both studies. Through a fine-grained analysis of substitution errors, we further show that different kinds of errors are suggestive of how speakers prioritize form, meaning, and context-based information during lexical planning. Together, these findings illuminate the functional roles of past and future context in how speakers encode and choose words, offering a bridge between contextual predictability effects and the mechanisms of sentence planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u8fc7\u53bb\u548c\u672a\u6765\u8bed\u5883\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u524d\u540e\u8bed\u5883\u5bf9\u8bcd\u8bed\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u957f\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u9009\u62e9\u90fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u8bed\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea7\u751f\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u524d\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff08\u8fc7\u53bb\u8bed\u5883\u5bf9\u8bcd\u8bed\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u540e\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff08\u672a\u6765\u8bed\u5883\u5bf9\u8bcd\u8bed\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff09\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u591f\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u540e\u5411\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u89c4\u5212\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff1a1) \u91cd\u65b0\u68c0\u9a8c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u8bcd\u8bed\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u957f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b2) \u5728\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u66ff\u6362\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u5efa\u6a21\u8bcd\u6c47\u3001\u8bed\u5883\u548c\u4ea4\u6d41\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8fc7\u53bb\u548c\u672a\u6765\u8bed\u5883\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u90fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u66ff\u6362\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u5728\u8bcd\u6c47\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u5f62\u5f0f\u3001\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u5883\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fc7\u53bb\u548c\u672a\u6765\u8bed\u5883\u5728\u8bf4\u8bdd\u8005\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u8bcd\u8bed\u4e2d\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u5883\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u53e5\u5b50\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u4ea7\u751f\u4e2d\u524d\u540e\u8bed\u5883\u7684\u6574\u5408\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

However, existing methods 1) either adopt one-size-fits-all strategies that treat all spatial regions and feature channels equally, which may hinder the preservation of accurate old knowledge, 2) or focus solely on aligning local prototypes with global ones for old classes while overlooking their local representations in new data, leading to knowledge degradation. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Prototype-Guided Calibration Distillation (PGCD) and Dual-Aligned Prototype Distillation (DAPD) for CIMIS in this paper. Specifically, PGCD exploits prototype-to-feature similarity to calibrate class-specific distillation intensity in different spatial regions, effectively reinforcing reliable old knowledge and suppressing misleading information from old classes. Complementarily, DAPD aligns the local prototypes of old classes extracted from the current model with both global prototypes and local prototypes, further enhancing segmentation performance on old categories.

SparseRM first employs SAE to decompose LLM representations into interpretable directions that capture preference-relevant features. The representations are then projected onto these directions to compute alignment scores, which quantify the strength of each preference feature in the representations. A simple reward head aggregates these scores to predict preference scores. Experiments on three preference modeling tasks show that SparseRM achieves superior performance over most mainstream RMs while using less than 1% of trainable parameters.

Adhering to the principles of \"quantitative-oriented, expert-driven, and multi-validation,\" the benchmark establishes an evaluation framework covering 5 core dimensions, 54 sub-indicators, and 14,430 high-quality questions, encompassing insurance theoretical knowledge, industry understanding, safety and compliance, intelligent agent application, and logical rigor. Based on this benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted on 11 mainstream large language models. The evaluation results reveal that general-purpose models suffer from common bottlenecks such as weak actuarial capabilities and inadequate compliance adaptation. High-quality domain-specific training demonstrates significant advantages in insurance vertical scenarios but exhibits shortcomings in business adaptation and compliance. The evaluation also accurately identifies the common bottlenecks of current large models in professional scenarios such as insurance actuarial, underwriting and claim settlement reasoning, and compliant marketing copywriting. The establishment of CUFEInse not only fills the gap in professional evaluation benchmarks for the insurance field, providing academia and industry with a professional, systematic, and authoritative evaluation tool, but also its construction concept and methodology offer important references for the evaluation paradigm of large models in vertical fields, serving as an authoritative reference for academic model optimization and industrial model selection.

Most prior explainable AI (XAI) approaches have focused on interpreting and explaining how models make predictions. In contrast, we would like to understand how data can be explained with deep learning model training and propose a novel approach to understand the data via one of the most common media - language - so that humans can easily understand. Our approach proposes a pipeline to generate textual descriptions that can explain the data with large language models by incorporating external knowledge bases. However, generated data descriptions may still include irrelevant information, so we introduce to exploit influence estimation to choose the most informative textual descriptions, along with the CLIP score. Furthermore, based on the phenomenon of cross-modal transferability, we propose a novel benchmark task named cross-modal transfer classification to examine the effectiveness of our textual descriptions. In the experiment of zero-shot setting, we show that our textual descriptions are more effective than other baseline descriptions, and furthermore, we successfully boost the performance of the model trained only on images across all nine image classification datasets. These results are further supported by evaluation using GPT-4o.

Specifically, this paper first conducts a comprehensive analysis of the impact of random noise on the model's generation. We found that noise not only contains rich semantic information, but also allows for the erasure of unwanted semantics from it in an extremely simple way based on information theory, and using the equivalence between the generation process of diffusion model and semantic injection to inject semantics into the cleaned noise. Then, we mathematically decipher these observations and propose a simple but efficient training-free and universal two-step \"Semantic Erasure-Injection\" process to modulate the initial noise in T2C diffusion model.

In order to overcome the limitations of existing negative sampling strategies, such as vulnerability to false negatives, limited generalization, and lack of control over sample hardness, we propose DANS-KGC (Diffusion-based Adaptive Negative Sampling for Knowledge Graph Completion). DANS-KGC comprises three key components: the Difficulty Assessment Module (DAM), the Adaptive Negative Sampling Module (ANS), and the Dynamic Training Mechanism (DTM). DAM evaluates the learning difficulty of entities by integrating semantic and structural features. Based on this assessment, ANS employs a conditional diffusion model with difficulty-aware noise scheduling, leveraging semantic and neighborhood information during the denoising phase to generate negative samples of diverse hardness. DTM further enhances learning by dynamically adjusting the hardness distribution of negative samples throughout training, enabling a curriculum-style progression from easy to hard examples.

Yet traditional surveys face persistent challenges, including fixed-question formats, high costs, limited adaptability, and difficulties ensuring cross-cultural equivalence. While recent studies explore large language models (LLMs) to simulate survey responses, most are limited to structured questions, overlook the entire survey process, and risks under-representing marginalized groups due to training data biases. We introduce AlignSurvey, the first benchmark that systematically replicates and evaluates the full social survey pipeline using LLMs. It defines four tasks aligned with key survey stages: social role modeling, semi-structured interview modeling, attitude stance modeling and survey response modeling. It also provides task-specific evaluation metrics to assess alignment fidelity, consistency, and fairness at both individual and group levels, with a focus on demographic diversity. To support AlignSurvey, we construct a multi-tiered dataset architecture: (i) the Social Foundation Corpus, a cross-national resource with 44K+ interview dialogues and 400K+ structured survey records; and (ii) a suite of Entire-Pipeline Survey Datasets, including the expert-annotated AlignSurvey-Expert (ASE) and two nationally representative surveys for cross-cultural evaluation. We release the SurveyLM family, obtained through two-stage fine-tuning of open-source LLMs, and offer reference models for evaluating domain-specific alignment.

While recent methods have achieved remarkable performance, they often rely heavily on fully annotated datasets, which are costly and labor-intensive to obtain. In real-world scenarios, particularly in multi-label datasets, label noise is prevalent and severely degrades retrieval performance. Moreover, existing CMH approaches typically overlook the partial semantic overlaps inherent in multi-label data, limiting their robustness and generalization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Semantic-Consistent Bidirectional Contrastive Hashing (SCBCH). The framework comprises two complementary modules: (1) Cross-modal Semantic-Consistent Classification (CSCC), which leverages cross-modal semantic consistency to estimate sample reliability and reduce the impact of noisy labels; (2) Bidirectional Soft Contrastive Hashing (BSCH), which dynamically generates soft contrastive sample pairs based on multi-label semantic overlap, enabling adaptive contrastive learning between semantically similar and dissimilar samples across modalities.

Sometimes this causes situations of civil unrest such as protests, rallies, and marches. These events may be disruptive in nature and are often held without prior permission from the competent authority. Forecasting these events helps administrative officials take necessary action. Usually, protests are announced well in advance to encourage large participation. Therefore, by analyzing such announcements in news articles, planned events can be forecasted beforehand. We developed such a system in this paper to forecast social unrest events using topic modeling and word2vec to filter relevant news articles, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods to identify entities such as people, organizations, locations, and dates. Time normalization is applied to convert future date mentions into a standard format. In this paper, we have developed a geographically independent, generalized model to identify key features for filtering civil unrest events. There could be many mentions of entities, but only a few may actually be involved in the event.

A dual-criterion early stopping strategy enabled rapid convergence under limited calibration data, while dropout regularization and grouped temporal convolutions ensured stable generalization. During online operation, continuous EEG streams were processed in two-second sliding windows to generate class probabilities that dynamically modulated visual and auditory feedback according to decoding confidence. Across twenty real-time trials, the framework achieved 65% top-1 and 70% top-2 accuracy, outperforming offline evaluation (50% top-1). These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying diffusion-based EEG decoding under practical clinical constraints, maintaining reliable performance despite environmental variability and minimal preprocessing.

We argue that this challenge can be resolved by modeling the distribution of clean samples in the encoder embedding manifold. To this end, we propose the Manifold-Correcting Causal Flow (MC^2F), a two-module system that operates directly on sentence embeddings. A Stratified Riemannian Continuous Normalizing Flow (SR-CNF) learns the density of the clean data manifold. It identifies out-of-distribution embeddings, which are then corrected by a Geodesic Purification Solver. This solver projects adversarial points back onto the learned manifold via the shortest path, restoring a clean, semantically coherent representation. We conducted extensive evaluations on text classification (TC) across three datasets and multiple adversarial attacks.

However, the representational differences between unstructured and structured knowledge make LLMs inherently struggle to maintain logic consistency, leading to \\textit{Logic Drift} challenges in structured knowledge reasoning tasks such as Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Existing methods address this limitation by designing complex workflows embedded in prompts to guide LLM reasoning. Nevertheless, these approaches only provide input-level guidance and fail to fundamentally address the \\textit{Logic Drift} in LLM outputs. Additionally, their inflexible reasoning workflows cannot adapt to different tasks and knowledge graphs. To enhance LLMs' logic consistency in structured knowledge reasoning, we specifically target the logits output from the autoregressive generation process. We propose the \\textit{Logits-to-Logic} framework, which incorporates logits strengthening and logits filtering as core modules to correct logical defects in LLM outputs. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves LLMs' logic consistency in structured knowledge reasoning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple KGQA benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Logits-to-Logic\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9logits\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u548c\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86KGQA\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u95ee\u7b54\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f93\u5165\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u89e3\u51b3\u903b\u8f91\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Logits-to-Logic\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684logits\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1) logits\u5f3a\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2) logits\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ea0\u6b63LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u9762\u89e3\u51b3\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5c42\u9762\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2aKGQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u64cd\u4f5clogits\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u9762\u800c\u975e\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u5c42\u9762\uff0cLogits-to-Logic\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

To address this, recent work has applied Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to diffusion models, yielding significant improvements.~However, DPO-like methods exhibit two key limitations: 1) High computational cost,due to the entire model fine-tuning; 2) Sensitivity to reference model quality}, due to its tendency to introduce instability and bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework for human preference alignment in diffusion models (PC-Diffusion), using a lightweight, trainable Preference Classifier that directly models the relative preference between samples. By restricting preference learning to this classifier, PC-Diffusion decouples preference alignment from the generative model, eliminating the need for entire model fine-tuning and reference model reliance.~We further provide theoretical guarantees for PC-Diffusion:1) PC-Diffusion ensures that the preference-guided distributions are consistently propagated across timesteps. 2)The training objective of the preference classifier is equivalent to DPO, but does not require a reference model.3) The proposed preference-guided correction can progressively steer generation toward preference-aligned regions.~Empirical results show that PC-Diffusion achieves comparable preference consistency to DPO while significantly reducing training costs and enabling efficient and stable preference-guided generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "PC-Diffusion\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u504f\u597d\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0eDPO\u76f8\u5f53\u6548\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684DPO\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff1b2\uff09\u5bf9\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPC-Diffusion\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u6837\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u9650\u5236\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9010\u6b65\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u671d\u5411\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660ePC-Diffusion\u5728\u504f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0eDPO\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u4e14\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8eDPO\u4f46\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "PC-Diffusion\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfDPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\u3002"}}

Our framework focuses on practicality, demonstrating extensibility beyond wired EEG devices to portable, wireless hardware. A user identification module recognizes the operator and provides a personalized, user-specific service. To achieve seamless, real-time operation, we utilize the lab streaming layer to manage the continuous streaming of live EEG signals to the personalized decoder. This end-to-end pipeline enables a functional real-time application capable of classifying user commands from imagined speech EEG signals, achieving an overall 4-class accuracy of 62.00 % on a wired device and 46.67 % on a portable wireless headset.

This dependency not only limits scalability and generalization but also restricts adaptability to diverse application scenarios. In this paper, a general-purpose foundation model for SAR land-cover classification is developed, serving as a robust cornerstone to accelerate the development and deployment of various downstream models. Specifically, a Dynamic Instance and Contour Consistency Contrastive Learning (DI3CL) pre-training framework is presented, which incorporates a Dynamic Instance (DI) module and a Contour Consistency (CC) module. DI module enhances global contextual awareness by enforcing local consistency across different views of the same region. CC module leverages shallow feature maps to guide the model to focus on the geometric contours of SAR land-cover objects, thereby improving structural discrimination. Additionally, to enhance robustness and generalization during pre-training, a large-scale and diverse dataset named SARSense, comprising 460,532 SAR images, is constructed to enable the model to capture comprehensive and representative features. To evaluate the generalization capability of our foundation model, we conducted extensive experiments across a variety of SAR land-cover classification tasks, including SAR land-cover mapping, water body detection, and road extraction. The results consistently demonstrate that the proposed DI3CL outperforms existing methods.

Extended version with full Appendix", "summary": "Efficient retrieval of external knowledge bases and web pages is crucial for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs. Previous works on training LLMs to leverage external retrievers for solving complex problems have predominantly employed end-to-end reinforcement learning. However, these approaches neglect supervision over the reasoning process, making it difficult to guarantee logical coherence and rigor. To address these limitations, we propose Thinker, a hierarchical thinking model for deep search through multi-turn interaction, making the reasoning process supervisable and verifiable. It decomposes complex problems into independently solvable sub-problems, each dually represented in both natural language and an equivalent logical function to support knowledge base and web searches. Concurrently, dependencies between sub-problems are passed as parameters via these logical functions, enhancing the logical coherence of the problem-solving process. To avoid unnecessary external searches, we perform knowledge boundary determination to check if a sub-problem is within the LLM's intrinsic knowledge, allowing it to answer directly. Experimental results indicate that with as few as several hundred training samples, the performance of Thinker is competitive with established baselines. Furthermore, when scaled to the full training set, Thinker significantly outperforms these methods across various datasets and model sizes.

However, a key challenge arises from the inherent mismatch between the discrete token outputs of MLLMs and the continuous nature of quality scores required by IQA tasks. This discrepancy significantly hinders the performance of MLLM-based IQA methods. Previous approaches that convert discrete token predictions into continuous scores often suffer from conversion errors. Moreover, the semantic confusion introduced by level tokens (e.g., ``good'') further constrains the performance of MLLMs on IQA tasks and degrades their original capabilities for related tasks.

A major challenge lies in modeling the intrinsic stochasticity of temporal dynamics, as real-world sequences often exhibit random fluctuations and localized variations. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, their generation process is computationally inefficient, often requiring hundreds to thousands of expensive function evaluations per sample. Flow matching has emerged as a more efficient paradigm, yet its conventional ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based formulation fails to explicitly capture stochasticity, thereby limiting the fidelity of generated sequences. By contrast, stochastic differential equation (SDE) are naturally suited for modeling randomness and uncertainty. Motivated by these insights, we propose TimeFlow, a novel SDE-based flow matching framework that integrates a encoder-only architecture. Specifically, we design a component-wise decomposed velocity field to capture the multi-faceted structure of time series and augment the vanilla flow-matching optimization with an additional stochastic term to enhance representational expressiveness. TimeFlow is flexible and general, supporting both unconditional and conditional generation tasks within a unified framework.

To this end, we introduce WorkBench, the first unified evaluation suite spanning six work-related tasks formulated explicitly as ranking problems, establishing a common ground for multi-task progress. Based on this benchmark, we find significant positive cross-task transfer, and use this insight to compose task-specific bipartite graphs from real-world data, synthetically enriched through grounding. This leads to Unified Work Embeddings (UWE), a task-agnostic bi-encoder that exploits our training-data structure with a many-to-many InfoNCE objective, and leverages token-level embeddings with task-agnostic soft late interaction.

Among them, training-free approaches are gaining attention for their flexibility and generalization over training-based methods. However, they typically struggle with accuracy and efficiency in practical deployment. To address the problems, we propose Sparse3DPR, a novel training-free framework for open-ended scene understanding, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and requires only sparse-view RGB inputs. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical plane-enhanced scene graph that supports open vocabulary and adopts dominant planar structures as spatial anchors, which enables clearer reasoning chains and more reliable high-level inferences.

Addressing these challenges, we introduce VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive cardiac diagnosis (VARS), an innovative approach that employs a graph-based representation to uniformly model heterogeneous ECG signals. VARS stands out by transforming ECG signals into versatile graph structures that capture critical diagnostic features, irrespective of signal diversity in the lead count, sampling frequency, and duration. This graph-centric formulation also enhances diagnostic sensitivity, enabling precise localization and identification of abnormal ECG patterns that often elude standard analysis methods. To facilitate representation transformation, our approach integrates denoising reconstruction with contrastive learning to preserve raw ECG information while highlighting pathognomonic patterns. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of VARS on three distinct ECG datasets, encompassing a range of structural variations. The results demonstrate that VARS not only consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art models across all these datasets but also exhibits substantial improvement in identifying risk signals. Additionally, VARS offers interpretability by pinpointing the exact waveforms that lead to specific model outputs, thereby assisting clinicians in making informed decisions. These findings suggest that our VARS will likely emerge as an invaluable tool for comprehensive cardiac health assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "VARS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u914d\u7f6e\u7684ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53bb\u566a\u91cd\u5efa\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\uff1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u914d\u7f6eECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u53f7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVARS\uff08VersAtile and Risk-Sensitive\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u6784ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53bb\u566a\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cbECG\u4fe1\u606f\u53c8\u7a81\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u75c5\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684ECG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cVARS\u59cb\u7ec8\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u786e\u5207\u6ce2\u5f62\u3002", "conclusion": "VARS\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u7efc\u5408\u5fc3\u810f\u5065\u5eb7\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u8bca\u65ad\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Existing automated systems are typically limited to shallow parsing, failing to extract the actionable intelligence needed for operational decisions. We formalize the complete interpretation task as deep parsing, a dual-reasoning challenge requiring both dynamic knowledge grounding (linking the NOTAM to evolving real-world aeronautical data) and schema-based inference (applying static domain rules to deduce operational status). To tackle this challenge, we propose NOTAM-Evolve, a self-evolving framework that enables a large language model (LLM) to autonomously master complex NOTAM interpretation. Leveraging a knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval module for data grounding, the framework introduces a closed-loop learning process where the LLM progressively improves from its own outputs, minimizing the need for extensive human-annotated reasoning traces. In conjunction with this framework, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs. Our experiments demonstrate that NOTAM-Evolve achieves a 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over the base LLM, establishing a new state of the art on the task of structured NOTAM interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "NOTAM-Evolve\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u638c\u63e1\u590d\u6742\u822a\u7a7a\u901a\u544a\u89e3\u8bfb\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534730.4%\u3002", "motivation": "\u822a\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eNOTAM\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u89e3\u8bfb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7b80\u7ec3\u96be\u61c2\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed9\u4eba\u5de5\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5904\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u6d45\u5c42\u89e3\u6790\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u64cd\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u6240\u9700\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u60c5\u62a5\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u822a\u7a7a\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u6211\u6f14\u5316\u7684NOTAM-Evolve\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06NOTAM\u89e3\u8bfb\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u89e3\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u95ed\u73af\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8ba9LLM\u4ece\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b10,000\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8NOTAM\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNOTAM-Evolve\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840LLM\u5b9e\u73b030.4%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316NOTAM\u89e3\u8bfb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "NOTAM-Evolve\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u822a\u7a7a\u901a\u544a\u89e3\u8bfb\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u822a\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740LLM\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we investigate synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI$^s$) as an enhancement to standard diffusion-based protocols. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across six state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using 200 patients with co-registered CDI$^s$, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) sequences. We demonstrate that CDI$^s$ integration reliably enhances or preserves segmentation performance in 94% of evaluated configurations, with individual architectures achieving up to 72.5% statistically significant relative improvement over baseline modalities.

Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples.

Such strategy can derive the fine-grained scene semantic structures while significantly reduce redundant computations. We further take these scene hints and movement direction derived from instructions for motion control via frame-wise scene query.

To appear in AAAI 2026", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across specialized domains, motivating research into their application to legal reasoning. However, existing legal benchmarks often conflate factual recall with genuine inference, fragment the reasoning process, and overlook the quality of reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce MSLR, the first Chinese multi-step legal reasoning dataset grounded in real-world judicial decision making. MSLR adopts the IRAC framework (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) to model structured expert reasoning from official legal documents. In addition, we design a scalable Human-LLM collaborative annotation pipeline that efficiently produces fine-grained step-level reasoning annotations and provides a reusable methodological framework for multi-step reasoning datasets. Evaluation of multiple LLMs on MSLR shows only moderate performance, highlighting the challenges of adapting to complex legal reasoning. Further experiments demonstrate that Self-Initiated Chain-of-Thought prompts generated by models autonomously improve reasoning coherence and quality, outperforming human-designed prompts. MSLR contributes to advancing LLM reasoning and Chain-of-Thought strategies and offers open resources for future research.

Advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven significant progress in unified structural QA frameworks like TrustUQA. However, these frameworks face challenges when applied to small-scale LLMs since small-scale LLMs are prone to errors in generating structured queries. To improve the structured data QA ability of small-scale LLMs, we propose a self-correction distillation (SCD) method. In SCD, an error prompt mechanism (EPM) is designed to detect errors and provide customized error messages during inference, and a two-stage distillation strategy is designed to transfer large-scale LLMs' query-generation and error-correction capabilities to small-scale LLM. Experiments across 5 benchmarks with 3 structured data types demonstrate that our SCD achieves the best performance and superior generalization on small-scale LLM (8B) compared to other distillation methods, and closely approaches the performance of GPT4 on some datasets.

The problem is complex due to the intricate spatial and temporal interdependence among regions. Prior works study the spatial and temporal dependency in a decouple manner, failing to capture their joint effect. In this work, we propose ST-SAM, a novel and efficient Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention Model for traffic forecasting. ST-SAM uses a region embedding layer to learn time-specific embedding from traffic data for regions. Then, it employs a spatial-temporal dependency learning module based on self-attention mechanism to capture the joint spatial-temporal dependency for both nearby and faraway regions. ST-SAM entirely relies on self-attention to capture both local and global spatial-temporal correlations, which make it effective and efficient. Extensive experiments on two real world datasets show that ST-SAM is substantially more accurate and efficient than the state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to 15% on RMSE, 17% on MAPE, and 32 times on training time in our experiments).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faST-SAM\u65f6\u7a7a\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8054\u5408\u6355\u83b7\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387(\u5e73\u5747RMSE\u964d\u4f4e15%\uff0cMAPE\u964d\u4f4e17%)\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387(\u63d0\u534732\u500d)\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u89e3\u8026\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8054\u5408\u6548\u5e94\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u533a\u57df\u5173\u8054\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "ST-SAM\u91c7\u7528\u533a\u57df\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6bb5\u7684\u533a\u57df\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u5f0f\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u90bb\u8fd1\u548c\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8054\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cST-SAM\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534715%(RMSE)\u548c17%(MAPE)\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534732\u500d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-SAM\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u52a0\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

These constraints cause a lack of geometric cues and reduced accuracy in occluded or truncated scenes. While recent approaches incorporate additional depth information to address geometric ambiguity, they overlook the visual cues crucial for robust recognition. We propose MonoCLUE, which enhances monocular 3D detection by leveraging both local clustering and generalized scene memory of visual features. First, we perform K-means clustering on visual features to capture distinct object-level appearance parts (e.g., bonnet, car roof), improving detection of partially visible objects. The clustered features are propagated across regions to capture objects with similar appearances. Second, we construct a generalized scene memory by aggregating clustered features across images, providing consistent representations that generalize across scenes.

However, these models are often restricted by a ``single-task-single-model'' paradigm, severely limiting their generalizability and scalability in multi-task scenarios. Motivated by the cross-domain generalization ability of large language models, we propose a universal visual perception framework based on flow matching that can generate diverse visual representations across multiple tasks. Our approach formulates the process as a universal flow-matching problem from image patch tokens to task-specific representations rather than an independent generation or regression problem. By leveraging a strong self-supervised foundation model as the anchor and introducing a multi-scale, circular task embedding mechanism, our method learns a universal velocity field to bridge the gap between heterogeneous tasks, supporting efficient and flexible representation transfer. Extensive experiments on classification, detection, segmentation, depth estimation, and image-text retrieval demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, outperforming prior generalist and several specialist models. Ablation studies further validate the robustness, scalability, and generalization of our framework.

While manually crafting CQs can be highly time-consuming and costly for ontology engineers, recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate this process. However, prior approaches have largely evaluated generated CQs based on their similarity to existing datasets, which often fail to verify semantic pitfalls such as \"Misusing allValuesFrom\". Since such pitfalls cannot be reliably detected through rule-based methods, we propose a novel dataset and model of Validating Semantic Pitfalls in Ontology (VSPO) for CQ generation specifically designed to verify the semantic pitfalls. To simulate missing and misused axioms, we use LLMs to generate natural language definitions of classes and properties and introduce misalignments between the definitions and the ontology by removing axioms or altering logical operators (e.g., substituting union with intersection). We then fine-tune LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to generate CQs that validate these semantic discrepancies between the provided definitions and the corresponding axioms. The resulting CQs can detect a broader range of modeling errors compared to existing public datasets.

Drawing on corpora of science fiction (Gollancz SF Masterworks) and general fiction (NovelTM), we operationalise Darko Suvin's theory of estrangement as computationally measurable deviation in token prediction, using RoBERTa to generate lexical substitutes for masked referents and classifying them via Gemini. We quantify conceptual slippage through three metrics: retention rate, replacement rate, and entropy, mapping the stability or disruption of category boundaries across genres. Our findings reveal that science fiction exhibits heightened conceptual permeability, particularly around machine referents, which show significant cross-category substitution and dispersion. Human terms, by contrast, maintain semantic coherence and often anchor substitutional hierarchies. These patterns suggest a genre-specific restructuring within anthropocentric logics. We argue that estrangement in science fiction operates as a controlled perturbation of semantic norms, detectable through probabilistic modelling, and that MLMs, when used critically, serve as interpretive instruments capable of surfacing genre-conditioned ontological assumptions. This study contributes to the methodological repertoire of computational literary studies and offers new insights into the linguistic infrastructure of science fiction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u8ba1\u7b97\u79d1\u5e7b\u6587\u5b66\u5982\u4f55\u6253\u7834\u4eba\u7c7b\u3001\u52a8\u7269\u548c\u673a\u5668\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u79d1\u5e7b\u6587\u5b66\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6e17\u900f\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u673a\u5668\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u79d1\u5e7b\u6587\u5b66\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u624b\u6bb5\u6253\u7834\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u5206\u7c7b\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8cDarko Suvin\u7684\"\u964c\u751f\u5316\"\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u6587\u5b66\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e3b\u4e49\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528RoBERTa\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u79d1\u5e7b\u6587\u5b66(Gollancz SF\u5927\u5e08\u4f5c\u54c1)\u548c\u666e\u901a\u6587\u5b66(NovelTM)\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u63a9\u7801\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Gemini\u5206\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u8bcd\u6c47\u66ff\u6362\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4fdd\u7559\u7387\u3001\u66ff\u6362\u7387\u548c\u71b5\u4e09\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u6982\u5ff5\u6ed1\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u79d1\u5e7b\u6587\u5b66\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6e17\u900f\u6027\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u6982\u5ff5\u8de8\u7c7b\u522b\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u5206\u6563\u73b0\u8c61\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u6210\u4e3a\u66ff\u6362\u5c42\u7ea7\u4e2d\u7684\u951a\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79d1\u5e7b\u6587\u5b66\u7684\u964c\u751f\u5316\u6548\u679c\u662f\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1bMLM\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\u5236\u7ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6587\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent studies control sketch features at stroke-level by editing values of stroke embeddings as conditions. However, in order to provide generator a global view about what a sketch is going to be drawn, all these edited conditions should be collected and fed into generator simultaneously before generation starts, i.e., no further manipulation is allowed during sketch generating process. In order to realize sketch drawing manipulation more flexibly, we propose a hierarchical auto-regressive sketch generating process. Instead of generating an entire sketch at once, each stroke in a sketch is generated in a three-staged hierarchy: 1) predicting a stroke embedding to represent which stroke is going to be drawn, and 2) anchoring the predicted stroke on the canvas, and 3) translating the embedding to a sequence of drawing actions to form the full sketch. Moreover, the stroke prediction, anchoring and translation are proceeded auto-regressively, i.e., both the recently generated strokes and their positions are considered to predict the current one, guiding model to produce an appropriate stroke at a suitable position to benefit the full sketch generation. It is flexible to manipulate stroke-level sketch drawing at any time during generation by adjusting the exposed editable stroke embeddings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u751f\u6210\uff08\u7b14\u5212\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u951a\u5b9a\u3001\u8f6c\u6362\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u7b14\u5212\u7ea7\u64cd\u63a7\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b14\u5212\u7ea7\u8349\u56fe\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f00\u59cb\u524d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6240\u6709\u7f16\u8f91\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7b14\u5212\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\uff1a1)\u9884\u6d4b\u7b14\u5212\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b2)\u5728\u753b\u5e03\u4e0a\u951a\u5b9a\u7b14\u5212\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b3)\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed8\u5236\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4e14\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5df2\u751f\u6210\u7b14\u5212\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u523b\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7b14\u5212\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u7075\u6d3b\u64cd\u63a7\u7b14\u5212\u7ea7\u8349\u56fe\u7ed8\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u548c\u64cd\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7b14\u5212\u7ea7\u8349\u56fe\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing studies on the expressive power of GNNs mainly focuses on simple single-relation graphs, and there is still insufficient discussion on the power of GNN to express logical rules in KGs. How to enhance the logical expressive power of GNNs is still a key issue. Motivated by this, we propose Path-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN), a method to enhance the logical expressive power of GNN by aggregating node-neighbor embeddings on the reasoning path. First, we analyze the logical expressive power of existing GNN-based methods and point out the shortcomings of the expressive power of these methods. Then, we theoretically investigate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN, showing that it not only has strictly stronger expressive power than C-GNN but also that its $(k+1)$-hop logical expressiveness is strictly superior to that of $k$-hop. Finally, we evaluate the logical expressive power of PN-GNN on six synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments confirm that PN-GNN enhances the expressive power of logical rules without compromising generalization, as evidenced by its competitive performance in KG reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPath-Neighbor\u589e\u5f3aGNN(PN-GNN)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u805a\u5408\u8282\u70b9-\u90bb\u5c45\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6bd4C-GNN\u548ck-hop\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eGNN\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u5355\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9GNN\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u8868\u8fbe\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u589e\u5f3aGNN\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u662f\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPath-Neighbor enhanced GNN (PN-GNN)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u805a\u5408\u8282\u70b9-\u90bb\u5c45\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709GNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1PN-GNN\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660ePN-GNN\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6bd4C-GNN\u5177\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5176(k+1)-hop\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u4e25\u683c\u4f18\u4e8ek-hop\uff1b\u57286\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c2\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u5728KG\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "PN-GNN\u901a\u8fc7\u8def\u5f84\u90bb\u5c45\u805a\u5408\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86GNN\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u90fd\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63a8\u7406\u4e2dGNN\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To analyze any image, it has to be converted to a simple binary image. This binarization process requires the knowledge of polarity of text in the images. Text polarity is defined as the contrast of text with respect to background. That means, text is darker than the background (dark text on bright background) or vice-versa. The binarization process uses this polarity information to convert the original colour or gray scale image into a binary image. In the literature, there is an intuitive approach based on power-law transformation on the original images. In this approach, the authors have illustrated an interesting phenomenon from the histogram statistics of the transformed images. Considering text and background as two classes, they have observed that maximum between-class variance between two classes is increasing (decreasing) for dark (bright) text on bright (dark) background. The corresponding empirical results have been presented. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of the above phenomenon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u6587\u672c\u6781\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e42\u5f8b\u53d8\u6362\u73b0\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u53d8\u6362\u540e\u7684\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6df1\u8272\u6587\u672c\u5728\u6d45\u8272\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u6d45\u8272\u6587\u672c\u5728\u6df1\u8272\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u6781\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7801\u8bc6\u522b\u7b49\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e42\u5f8b\u53d8\u6362\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6700\u5927\u7c7b\u95f4\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u589e\u51cf\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e42\u5f8b\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6781\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u73b0\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53d8\u6362\u540e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5e42\u5f8b\u53d8\u6362\u540e\uff0c\u6df1\u8272\u6587\u672c\u5728\u6d45\u8272\u80cc\u666f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u7c7b\u95f4\u65b9\u5dee\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u6d45\u8272\u6587\u672c\u5728\u6df1\u8272\u80cc\u666f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u7c7b\u95f4\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c0f\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u7406\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u6587\u672c\u6781\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u9884\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u76f8\u5173\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{AquaOV255}, the first large-scale and fine-grained underwater segmentation dataset containing 255 categories and over 20K images, covering diverse categories for open-vocabulary (OV) evaluation. Furthermore, we establish the first underwater OV segmentation benchmark, \\textbf{UOVSBench}, by integrating AquaOV255 with five additional underwater datasets to enable comprehensive evaluation.

Existing SSC methods have shown efficacy in improving 3D scene representations, but suffer from the inherent input-output dimension gap and annotation-reality density gap, where the 2D planner view from input images with sparse annotated labels leads to inferior prediction of real-world dense occupancy with a 3D stereoscopic view. In light of this, we propose the corresponding High-Dimension High-Density Semantic Scene Completion (HD$^2$-SSC) framework with expanded pixel semantics and refined voxel occupancies. To bridge the dimension gap, a High-dimension Semantic Decoupling module is designed to expand 2D image features along a pseudo third dimension, decoupling coarse pixel semantics from occlusions, and then identify focal regions with fine semantics to enrich image features. To mitigate the density gap, a High-density Occupancy Refinement module is devised with a \"detect-and-refine\" architecture to leverage contextual geometric and semantic structures for enhanced semantic density with the completion of missing voxels and correction of erroneous ones.

To explore this issue, we propose a new perturbation framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning ability in complex environments by injecting additional semantically irrelevant perturbation sentences and gradually increasing the perturbation intensity. At the same time, we use an additional perturbation method: core questioning instruction missing, to further analyze the LLMs' problem-solving mechanism. The experimental results show that LLMs perform stably when facing perturbation sentences without numbers, but there is also a robustness boundary. As the perturbation intensity increases, the performance exhibits varying degrees of decline; when facing perturbation sentences with numbers, the performance decreases more significantly, most open source models with smaller parameters decrease by nearly or even more than 10%, and further increasing with the enhancement of perturbation intensity, with the maximum decrease reaching 51.55%. Even the most advanced commercial LLMs have seen a 3%-10% performance drop. By analyzing the reasoning process of LLMs in detail, We find that models are more sensitive to perturbations with numerical information and are more likely to give incorrect answers when disturbed by irrelevant numerical information. The higher the perturbation intensity, the more obvious these defects are. At the same time, in the absence of core questioning instruction, models can still maintain an accuracy of 20%-40%, indicating that LLMs may rely on memory templates or pattern matching to complete the task, rather than logical reasoning.

The terrain depth has a significant impact on the calculated path safety. The craters and hills on the surface cannot be distinguished in a two-dimensional image. The proposed method uses a disparity map of the terrain that is generated by using a UAV. Several computer vision techniques, including edge, line and corner detection methods, as well as the stereo depth reconstruction technique, are applied to the captured images and the found disparity map is used to define candidate way-points of the trajectory.

While large language models(LLMs) show promise in such tasks, their application to biomolecular problems is hindered by logical inconsistencies and the lack of grounding in domain knowledge. Existing approaches often exacerbate these issues: reasoning steps may deviate from biological facts or fail to capture long mechanistic dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose a Knowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning framework that integrates LLMs with knowledge graph-based multi-hop reasoning chains. The framework constructs mechanistic chains via guided multi-hop traversal and pruning on the knowledge graph; these chains are then incorporated into supervised fine-tuning to improve factual grounding and further refined with reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning reliability and consistency. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of existing benchmarks, which are often restricted in scale and scope and lack annotations for deep reasoning chains, we introduce PrimeKGQA, a comprehensive benchmark for biomolecular question answering. Experimental results on both PrimeKGQA and existing datasets demonstrate that although larger closed-source models still perform well on relatively simple tasks, our method demonstrates clear advantages as reasoning depth increases, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-hop tasks that demand traversal of structured biological knowledge. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured knowledge with advanced reasoning strategies for reliable and interpretable biomolecular reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u957f\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\u9700\u8981\u8de8\u8d8a\u5206\u5b50\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ea7\u8054\u548c\u4ee3\u8c22\u9014\u5f84\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u52a0\u5267\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKnowledge-Augmented Long-CoT Reasoning\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u591a\u8df3\u904d\u5386\u548c\u4fee\u526a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5236\u94fe\uff1b2) \u5c06\u673a\u5236\u94fe\u878d\u5165\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b4) \u5f15\u5165PrimeKGQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728PrimeKGQA\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5927\u578b\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u904d\u5386\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u751f\u7269\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, recent research reveals that LLMs still exhibit performance gaps in Document-level Relation Extraction (DocRE) as requiring fine-grained comprehension. The commonly adopted \"extract entities then predict relations\" paradigm in LLM-based methods leads to these gaps due to two main reasons: (1) Numerous unrelated entity pairs introduce noise and interfere with the relation prediction for truly related entity pairs. (2) Although LLMs have identified semantic associations between entities, relation labels beyond the predefined set are still treated as prediction errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Relation as a Prior (RelPrior) paradigm for LLM-based DocRE. For challenge (1), RelPrior utilizes binary relation as a prior to extract and determine whether two entities are correlated, thereby filtering out irrelevant entity pairs and reducing prediction noise. For challenge (2), RelPrior utilizes predefined relation as a prior to match entities for triples extraction instead of directly predicting relation. Thus, it avoids misjudgment caused by strict predefined relation labeling.

Code is available at https://github.com/AIPMLab/FedMedCLIP", "summary": "Despite the remarkable performance of deep models in medical imaging, they still require source data for training, which limits their potential in light of privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL), as a decentralized learning framework that trains a shared model with multiple hospitals (a.k.a., FL clients), provides a feasible solution. However, data heterogeneity and resource costs hinder the deployment of FL models, especially when using vision language models (VLM). To address these challenges, we propose a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) based FL approach for medical image classification (FedMedCLIP). Specifically, we introduce a masked feature adaptation module (FAM) as a communication module to reduce the communication load while freezing the CLIP encoders to reduce the computational overhead. Furthermore, we propose a masked multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a private local classifier to adapt to the client tasks. Moreover, we design an adaptive Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based distillation regularization method to enable mutual learning between FAM and MLP. Finally, we incorporate model compression to transmit the FAM parameters while using ensemble predictions for classification.

But does this assumption hold for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Sanskrit? We address this question by comparing instruction-tuned and in-context-prompted LLMs with smaller task-specific encoder-decoder models on the Sanskrit poetry-to-prose conversion task. This task is intrinsically challenging: Sanskrit verse exhibits free word order combined with rigid metrical constraints, and its conversion to canonical prose (anvaya) requires multi-step reasoning involving compound segmentation, dependency resolution, and syntactic linearisation. This makes it an ideal testbed to evaluate whether LLMs can surpass specialised models. For LLMs, we apply instruction fine-tuning on general-purpose models and design in-context learning templates grounded in Paninian grammar and classical commentary heuristics. For task-specific modelling, we fully fine-tune a ByT5-Sanskrit Seq2Seq model. Our experiments show that domain-specific fine-tuning of ByT5-Sanskrit significantly outperforms all instruction-driven LLM approaches. Human evaluation strongly corroborates this result, with scores exhibiting high correlation with Kendall's Tau scores. Additionally, our prompting strategies provide an alternative to fine-tuning when domain-specific verse corpora are unavailable, and the task-specific Seq2Seq model demonstrates robust generalisation on out-of-domain evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u68b5\u8bed\u8bd7\u6b4c\u5230\u6563\u6587\u8f6c\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff08ByT5-Sanskrit\uff09\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86LLM\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u90fd\u662f\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5982\u68b5\u8bed\u3002\u68b5\u8bed\u8bd7\u6b4c\u5230\u6563\u6587\u8f6c\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u8bcd\u5e8f\u3001\u4e25\u683c\u97f5\u5f8b\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63d0\u793a\u7684LLM\u4e0e\u4e13\u95e8\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5bf9LLM\u5e94\u7528\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce2\u5c3c\u5c3c\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u53e4\u5178\u6ce8\u91ca\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u677f\uff1b\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03ByT5-Sanskrit\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684ByT5-Sanskrit\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f3a\u70c8\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5206\u6570\u4e0eKendall's Tau\u5206\u6570\u5448\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bd7\u6b4c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684Seq2Seq\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57df\u5916\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u6280\u672f\u4e0d\u65ad\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u4ecd\u7136\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5f62\u6001\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency.

Accepted to WACV 2026", "summary": "Change detection (CD) is fundamental to computer vision and remote sensing, supporting applications in environmental monitoring, disaster response, and urban development. Most CD models assume co-registered inputs, yet real-world imagery often exhibits parallax, viewpoint shifts, and long temporal gaps that cause severe misalignment. Traditional two stage methods that first register and then detect, as well as recent joint frameworks (e.g., BiFA, ChangeRD), still struggle under large displacements, relying on regression only flow, global homographies, or synthetic perturbations. We present DiffRegCD, an integrated framework that unifies dense registration and change detection in a single model. DiffRegCD reformulates correspondence estimation as a Gaussian smoothed classification task, achieving sub-pixel accuracy and stable training. It leverages frozen multi-scale features from a pretrained denoising diffusion model, ensuring robustness to illumination and viewpoint variation. Supervision is provided through controlled affine perturbations applied to standard CD datasets, yielding paired ground truth for both flow and change detection without pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on aerial (LEVIR-CD, DSIFN-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD) and ground level (VL-CMU-CD) datasets show that DiffRegCD consistently surpasses recent baselines and remains reliable under wide temporal and geometric variation, establishing diffusion features and classification based correspondence as a strong foundation for unified change detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiffRegCD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u914d\u51c6\u4e0e\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5927\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u5df2\u914d\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u5dee\u3001\u89c6\u89d2\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u9519\u4f4d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8fd1\u671f\u8054\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5927\u4f4d\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiffRegCD\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5e73\u6ed1\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u50cf\u7d20\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u786e\u4fdd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u4eff\u5c04\u6270\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u914d\u5bf9\u771f\u503c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728LEVIR-CD\u3001DSIFN-CD\u3001WHU-CD\u3001SYSU-CD\u7b49\u822a\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cVL-CMU-CD\u5730\u9762\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDiffRegCD\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u8fd1\u671f\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u57fa\u7840\uff0cDiffRegCD\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Currently, TFG methods based on Neural Radiated Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian sputtering (3DGS) are received widespread attention. They learn and store personalized features from reference videos of each target individual to generate realistic speaking videos. To ensure models can capture sufficient 3D information and successfully learns the lip-audio mapping, previous studies usually require meticulous processing and fitting several minutes of reference video, which always takes hours. The computational burden of processing and fitting long reference videos severely limits the practical application value of these methods.However, is it really necessary to fit such minutes of reference video? Our exploratory case studies show that using some informative reference video segments of just a few seconds can achieve performance comparable to or even better than the full reference video. This indicates that video informative quality is much more important than its length. Inspired by this observation, we propose the ISExplore (short for Informative Segment Explore), a simple-yet-effective segment selection strategy that automatically identifies the informative 5-second reference video segment based on three key data quality dimensions: audio feature diversity, lip movement amplitude, and number of camera views.

The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations.

This article presents an embedding-based benchmarking framework to detect bias in LLMs in the context of formative feedback. Using 600 authentic student essays from the AES 2.0 corpus, we constructed controlled counterfactuals along two dimensions: (i) implicit cues via lexicon-based swaps of gendered terms within essays, and (ii) explicit cues via gendered author background in the prompt. We investigated six representative LLMs (i.e. GPT-5 mini, GPT-4o mini, DeepSeek-R1, DeepSeek-R1-Qwen, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama-3-8B). We first quantified the response divergence with cosine and Euclidean distances over sentence embeddings, then assessed significance via permutation tests, and finally, visualised structure using dimensionality reduction. In all models, implicit manipulations reliably induced larger semantic shifts for male-female counterfactuals than for female-male. Only the GPT and Llama models showed sensitivity to explicit gender cues. These findings show that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit asymmetric semantic responses to gender substitutions, suggesting persistent gender biases in feedback they provide learners. Qualitative analyses further revealed consistent linguistic differences (e.g., more autonomy-supportive feedback under male cues vs. more controlling feedback under female cues).

A key challenge is that pathological tasks typically provide only bag-level labels, while instance-level descriptions generated by LLMs often suffer from bias due to a lack of fine-grained medical knowledge. To address this, we propose that constructing task-specific pathological entity prototypes is crucial for learning generalizable features and enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, existing vision-language MIL methods often employ unidirectional guidance, limiting cross-modal synergy. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Multimodal Prototype-based Multi-Instance Learning, that promotes bidirectional interaction through a balanced information compression scheme. Specifically, we leverage a frozen LLM to generate task-specific pathological entity descriptions, which are learned as text prototypes.

For the fusion stage, we employ the Stereoscopic Optimal Transport (SOT) algorithm, which is based on a similarity metric, thereby facilitating broader semantic alignment in a higher-dimensional space.

Anomaly detection in this type of data constitutes a challenging problem yet with numerous applications in science and engineering because anomaly scores come from the simultaneous consideration of the temporal and variable relationships. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based approach to detect anomalies concerning the amplitude and the shape of multivariate time series. First, we use a sliding window to generate a set of multivariate subsequences and thereafter apply an extended fuzzy clustering to reveal a structure present within the generated multivariate subsequences. Finally, a reconstruction criterion is employed to reconstruct the multivariate subsequences with the optimal cluster centers and the partition matrix. We construct a confidence index to quantify a level of anomaly detected in the series and apply Particle Swarm Optimization as an optimization vehicle for the problem of anomaly detection. Experimental studies completed on several synthetic and six real-world datasets suggest that the proposed methods can detect the anomalies in multivariate time series. With the help of available clusters revealed by the extended fuzzy clustering, the proposed framework can detect anomalies in the multivariate time series and is suitable for identifying anomalous amplitude and shape patterns in various application domains such as health care, weather data analysis, finance, and disease outbreak detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u5219\u8bc6\u522b\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4f46\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5143\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u6a21\u7cca\u805a\u7c7b\u63ed\u793a\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u5219\u91cd\u5efa\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7f6e\u4fe1\u6307\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u5f02\u5e38\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u516d\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u68c0\u6d4b\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u8bc6\u522b\u5404\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM). Accepted Manuscript version uploaded", "summary": "Extracting robust discriminative features is a critical challenge in person re-identification (ReID). While Transformer-based methods have successfully addressed some limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as their local processing nature and information loss resulting from convolution and downsampling operations, they still face the scalability issue due to the quadratic increase in memory and computational requirements with the length of the input sequence. To overcome this, we propose a pure Mamba-based person ReID framework named ReIDMamba. Specifically, we have designed a Mamba-based strong baseline that effectively leverages fine-grained, discriminative global features by introducing multiple class tokens. To further enhance robust features learning within Mamba, we have carefully designed two novel techniques. First, the multi-granularity feature extractor (MGFE) module, designed with a multi-branch architecture and class token fusion, effectively forms multi-granularity features, enhancing both discrimination ability and fine-grained coverage. Second, the ranking-aware triplet regularization (RATR) is introduced to reduce redundancy in features from multiple branches, enhancing the diversity of multi-granularity features by incorporating both intra-class and inter-class diversity constraints, thus ensuring the robustness of person features. To our knowledge, this is the pioneering work that integrates a purely Mamba-driven approach into ReID research. Our proposed ReIDMamba model boasts only one-third the parameters of TransReID, along with lower GPU memory usage and faster inference throughput. Experimental results demonstrate ReIDMamba's superior and promising performance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on five person ReID benchmarks.

Submitted to the Journal of Risk and Insurance (JRI), November 2025", "summary": "This paper develops a prudential framework for assessing the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in reinsurance. A five-pillar architecture--governance, data lineage, assurance, resilience, and regulatory alignment--translates supervisory expectations from Solvency II, SR 11-7, and guidance from EIOPA (2025), NAIC (2023), and IAIS (2024) into measurable lifecycle controls. The framework is implemented through the Reinsurance AI Reliability and Assurance Benchmark (RAIRAB), which evaluates whether governance-embedded LLMs meet prudential standards for grounding, transparency, and accountability. Across six task families, retrieval-grounded configurations achieved higher grounding accuracy (0.90), reduced hallucination and interpretive drift by roughly 40%, and nearly doubled transparency. These mechanisms lower informational frictions in risk transfer and capital allocation, showing that existing prudential doctrines already accommodate reliable AI when governance is explicit, data are traceable, and assurance is verifiable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u652f\u67f1\u67b6\u6784\u548cRAIRAB\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684LLM\u914d\u7f6e\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u5728\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5ba1\u614e\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7b26\u5408Solvency II\u3001SR 11-7\u7b49\u76d1\u7ba1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u8d44\u672c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e94\u652f\u67f1\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8840\u7f18\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3001\u97e7\u6027\u3001\u76d1\u7ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u76d1\u7ba1\u671f\u671b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u518d\u4fdd\u9669AI\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u57fa\u51c6\uff08RAIRAB\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u5d4c\u5165\u6cbb\u7406\u7684LLM\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ba1\u614e\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff080.90\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6f02\u79fb\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea640%\uff0c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u51e0\u4e4e\u7ffb\u500d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u6469\u64e6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u539f\u5219\u5df2\u7ecf\u80fd\u591f\u5bb9\u7eb3\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u524d\u63d0\u662f\u6cbb\u7406\u660e\u786e\u3001\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u3001\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3aLLM\u5728\u518d\u4fdd\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Our work addresses the crucial need for efficient and accurate translation of natural language queries into SQL expressions in various settings with the growing use of natural language interfaces. We explore the evolution of NLIDBs from early rule-based systems to advanced neural network-driven approaches. Drawing inspiration from the medical diagnostic process, we propose a novel framework integrating an error correction mechanism that diagnoses error types, identifies their causes, provides fixing instructions, and applies these corrections to SQL queries. This approach is further enriched by embedding fine-tuning and RAG, which harnesses external knowledge bases for improved accuracy and transparency.

Technically, we depart from the dynamic programming paradigm typically employed for treewidth-based algorithms and instead exploit structural characterizations of well-formed causal models, providing a new algorithmic toolkit for causal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u89c6\u89d2\u7814\u7a76Pearl\u56e0\u679c\u5c42\u6b21(PCH)\u7684\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6811\u5bbd\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u548cXP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u7684\u96be\u89e3\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "PCH\u662f\u63a8\u7406\u6982\u7387\u6027\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u6027\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9648\u8ff0\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u7ecf\u5178\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cPCH\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u662f\u96be\u5904\u7406\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u653e\u5f03\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u5bbd\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8f6c\u800c\u5229\u7528\u826f\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6027\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7247\u6bb5\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6811\u5bbd\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u548cXP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u7684\u96be\u89e3\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6027\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u4e3aPCH\u53ef\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6027\u7684\u5165\u53e3\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Unlike general text generation, parliamentary speeches require not only linguistic quality but also political authenticity and ideological consistency. Current language models lack specialized training for parliamentary contexts, and existing evaluation methods focus on standard NLP metrics rather than political authenticity. To address this, we present ParliaBench, a benchmark for parliamentary speech generation. We constructed a dataset of speeches from UK Parliament to enable systematic model training. We introduce an evaluation framework combining computational metrics with LLM-as-a-judge assessments for measuring generation quality across three dimensions: linguistic quality, semantic coherence, and political authenticity. We propose two novel embedding-based metrics, Political Spectrum Alignment and Party Alignment, to quantify ideological positioning. We fine-tuned five large language models (LLMs), generated 28k speeches, and evaluated them using our framework, comparing baseline and fine-tuned models. Results show that fine-tuning produces statistically significant improvements across the majority of metrics and our novel metrics demonstrate strong discriminative power for political dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ParliaBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u82f1\u56fd\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u6307\u6807\u548cLLM\u88c1\u5224\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u653f\u6cbb\u5149\u8c31\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u653f\u515a\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u751f\u6210\u6bd4\u4e00\u822c\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u8bed\u8a00\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u653f\u6cbb\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bae\u4f1a\u8bed\u5883\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6NLP\u6307\u6807\u800c\u975e\u653f\u6cbb\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u82f1\u56fd\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5305\u542b\u8bed\u8a00\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u653f\u6cbb\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba1\u7b97\u6307\u6807\u4e0eLLM-as-a-judge\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u653f\u6cbb\u5149\u8c31\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u653f\u515a\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e24\u4e2a\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5bf95\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u5e76\u751f\u621028k\u7bc7\u6f14\u8bb2\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8bae\u4f1a\u6f14\u8bb2\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u653f\u6cbb\u8bed\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Although it is quite popular to collect point clouds and images simultaneously, little attention has been paid to the usefulness of image data in 3D UDA when training the models. In this paper, we propose an approach named MMAssist that improves the performance of 3D UDA with multi-modal assistance. A method is designed to align 3D features between the source domain and the target domain by using image and text features as bridges. More specifically, we project the ground truth labels or pseudo labels to the images to get a set of 2D bounding boxes. For each 2D box, we extract its image feature from a pre-trained vision backbone. A large vision-language model (LVLM) is adopted to extract the box's text description, and a pre-trained text encoder is used to obtain its text feature. During the training of the model in the source domain and the student model in the target domain, we align the 3D features of the predicted boxes with their corresponding image and text features, and the 3D features and the aligned features are fused with learned weights for the final prediction. The features between the student branch and the teacher branch in the target domain are aligned as well. To enhance the pseudo labels, we use an off-the-shelf 2D object detector to generate 2D bounding boxes from images and estimate their corresponding 3D boxes with the aid of point cloud, and these 3D boxes are combined with the pseudo labels generated by the teacher model. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in three domain adaptation tasks on three popular 3D object detection datasets.

However, the complexity of machine learning models often limits their practical applicability due to a lack of interpretability. Additionally, many industrial machines lack comprehensive sensor technology, making data acquisition incomplete and challenging. Explainable Artificial Intelligence offers a solution by providing insights into model decision-making and identifying the most relevant features for classification. In this paper, we investigate the impact of feature reduction using XAI techniques on the quality classification of injection-molded parts. We apply SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME to analyze feature importance in a Long Short-Term Memory model trained on real production data. By reducing the original 19 input features to 9 and 6, we evaluate the trade-off between model accuracy, inference speed, and interpretability. Our results show that reducing features can improve generalization while maintaining high classification performance, with an small increase in inference speed. This approach enhances the feasibility of AI-driven quality control, particularly for industrial settings with limited sensor capabilities, and paves the way for more efficient and interpretable machine learning applications in manufacturing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7XAI\u6280\u672f\u5bf9LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u7f29\u51cf\uff0c\u5c0619\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u51cf\u5c11\u52306-9\u4e2a\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5de5\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u4e86AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5e94\u7528SHAP\u3001Grad-CAM\u548cLIME\u7b49XAI\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u751f\u4ea7\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u91cf\uff08\u4ece19\u4e2a\u51cf\u5c11\u52309\u4e2a\u548c6\u4e2a\uff09\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7279\u5f81\u7f29\u51cf\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u7565\u5fae\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eXAI\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7f29\u51cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u5236\u9020\u884c\u4e1a\u7684AI\u5e94\u7528\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

From this dataset, we extract a subset of tables that we introduce as Complex Hierarchical Tables (CHiTab): a benchmark collection of complex tables containing hierarchical headings. We adopt a series of prompt engineering strategies to probe the models' comprehension capabilities, experimenting with various prompt formats and writing styles. Multiple state-of-the-art open-weights VLLMs are evaluated on the benchmark first using their off-the-shelf versions and then fine-tuning some models on our task. We also measure the performance of humans to solve the task on a small set of tables comparing with performance of the evaluated VLLMs. The experiments support our intuition that generic VLLMs, not explicitly designed for understanding the structure of tables, can perform this task.

Synthetic data offers a promising solution to augment insufficient data sets and improve the robustness of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of incorporating synthetic data into the training process of the injection molding process using an existing Long Short-Term Memory architecture. Our approach is to generate synthetic data by simulating production cycles and incorporating them into the training data set. Through iterative experimentation with different proportions of synthetic data, we attempt to find an optimal balance that maximizes the benefits of synthetic data while preserving the authenticity and relevance of real data. Our results suggest that the inclusion of synthetic data improves the model's ability to handle different scenarios, with potential practical industrial applications to reduce manual labor, machine use, and material waste.

Speech-based assessments show promise for early detection, as phonetic motor planning deficits alter acoustic features (e.g., pitch, tone), while memory and language impairments lead to syntactic and semantic errors. However, conventional speech-processing pipelines with hand-crafted features or general-purpose audio classifiers often exhibit limited performance and generalizability. To address these limitations, we introduce SpeechCARE, a multimodal speech processing pipeline that leverages pretrained, multilingual acoustic and linguistic transformer models to capture subtle speech-related cues associated with cognitive impairment. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm, SpeechCARE employs a dynamic fusion architecture that weights transformer-based acoustic, linguistic, and demographic inputs, allowing integration of additional modalities (e.g., social factors, imaging) and enhancing robustness across diverse tasks. Its robust preprocessing includes automatic transcription, large language model (LLM)-based anomaly detection, and task identification. A SHAP-based explainability module and LLM reasoning highlight each modality's contribution to decision-making.

However, they can fall short, especially when required to account for personalization or specific knowledge. In real-life settings, it is impractical to rely on users to detect these errors and request a new response. One way to address this problem is to refine the response before returning it to the user. While existing approaches focus on refining responses within a single LLM, this method struggles to consider diverse aspects needed for effective conversations. In this work, we propose refining responses through a multi-agent framework, where each agent is assigned a specific role for each aspect. We focus on three key aspects crucial to conversational quality: factuality, personalization, and coherence. Each agent is responsible for reviewing and refining one of these aspects, and their feedback is then merged to improve the overall response. To enhance collaboration among them, we introduce a dynamic communication strategy. Instead of following a fixed sequence of agents, our approach adaptively selects and coordinates the most relevant agents based on the specific requirements of each query. We validate our framework on challenging conversational datasets, demonstrating that ours significantly outperforms relevant baselines, particularly in tasks involving knowledge or user's persona, or both.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u5bf9\u8bdd\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5206\u522b\u8d1f\u8d23\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u5730\u4f9d\u8d56\u7528\u6237\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e13\u95e8\u8d1f\u8d23\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\uff08\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u54cd\u5e94\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u6216\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We introduce SciAgent, a unified multi-agent system designed for generalistic scientific reasoning-the ability to adapt reasoning strategies across disciplines and difficulty levels. SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task.

Previous work for LLM agents typically relies on elaborate prompt engineering or fine-tuning with expert trajectories to improve performance. In this work, we take a different perspective: we explore constructing process reward models (PRMs) to evaluate each decision and guide the agent's decision-making process. Unlike LLM reasoning, where each step is scored based on correctness, actions in agent tasks do not have a clear-cut correctness. Instead, they should be evaluated based on their proximity to the goal and the progress they have made. Building on this insight, we propose a re-defined PRM for agent tasks, named AgentPRM, to capture both the interdependence between sequential decisions and their contribution to the final goal. This enables better progress tracking and exploration-exploitation balance. To scalably obtain labeled data for training AgentPRM, we employ a Temporal Difference-based (TD-based) estimation method combined with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE), which proves more sample-efficient than prior methods. Extensive experiments across different agentic tasks show that AgentPRM is over $8\\times$ more compute-efficient than baselines, and it demonstrates robust improvement when scaling up test-time compute. Moreover, we perform detailed analyses to show how our method works and offer more insights, e.g., applying AgentPRM to the reinforcement learning of LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AgentPRM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u8d21\u732e\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8f6e\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b08\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u7f51\u9875\u8d2d\u7269\u3001\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u5bfc\u822a\uff09\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6307\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgentPRM\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff1a\u4e0d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u63a5\u8fd1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u53d6\u5f97\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08GAE\uff09\u9ad8\u6548\u83b7\u53d6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "AgentPRM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad88\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentPRM\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

To compensate for the limited context, we leverage a pretrained Amodal Completion (AC) model to generate structure-aware candidates that serve as semantic priors for the missing regions. We introduce Context-Semantic Fusion Network (CSF-Net), a transformer-based fusion framework that fuses these candidates with contextual features to produce a semantic guidance image for image inpainting. This guidance improves inpainting quality by promoting structural accuracy and semantic consistency. CSF-Net can be seamlessly integrated into existing inpainting models without architectural changes and consistently enhances performance across diverse masking conditions.

Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) provide feedback after generating the final answers but fail to evaluate the process for multi-step reasoning. Traditional Process Reward Models (PRMs) evaluate the reasoning process but require costly human annotations or rollout generation. While implicit PRM is trained only with outcome signals and derives step rewards through reward parameterization without explicit annotations, it is more suitable for multi-step reasoning in MHQA tasks. However, existing implicit PRM has only been explored for plain text scenarios. When adapting to MHQA tasks, it cannot handle the graph structure constraints in KGs and capture the potential inconsistency between CoT and KG paths. To address these limitations, we propose the DPRM (Dual Implicit Process Reward Model). It trains two implicit PRMs for CoT and KG reasoning in MHQA tasks. Both PRMs, namely KG-PRM and CoT-PRM, derive step-level rewards from outcome signals via reward parameterization without additional explicit annotations. Among them, KG-PRM uses preference pairs to learn structural constraints from KGs. DPRM further introduces a consistency constraint between CoT and KG reasoning steps, making the two PRMs mutually verify and collaboratively optimize the reasoning paths. We also provide a theoretical demonstration of the derivation of process rewards.

Traditional weed management methods, primarily relying on chemical herbicides, risk environmental contamination and lead to the emergence of herbicide-resistant species. Precision weeding, leveraging computer vision and machine learning methods, offers a promising eco-friendly alternative but is often limited by reliance on high-power computational platforms. This work presents an optimized, low-power edge AI system for weeds detection based on the YOLOv8n object detector deployed on the STM32U575ZI microcontroller. Several compression techniques are applied to the detection model, including structured pruning, integer quantization and input image resolution scaling in order to meet strict hardware constraints. The model is trained and evaluated on the CropAndWeed dataset with 74 plant species, achieving a balanced trade-off between detection accuracy and efficiency.

To address this problem, we propose SharpV, a minimalist and efficient method for adaptive pruning of visual tokens and KV cache. Different from most uniform compression approaches, SharpV dynamically adjusts pruning ratios based on spatial-temporal information. Remarkably, this adaptive mechanism occasionally achieves performance gains over dense models, offering a novel paradigm for adaptive pruning. During the KV cache pruning stage, based on observations of visual information degradation, SharpV prunes degraded visual features via a self-calibration manner, guided by similarity to original visual features. In this way, SharpV achieves hierarchical cache pruning from the perspective of information bottleneck, offering a new insight into VideoLLMs' information flow. Experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of SharpV.

These data are often collected from online sources. This raises serious concerns about the protection of user data, as individuals may not have given consent for their data to be used in training. To address this concern, recent studies introduce the concept of unlearnable examples, i.e., data instances that appear natural but are intentionally altered to prevent models from effectively learning from them. While existing methods demonstrate empirical effectiveness, they typically rely on heuristic trials and lack formal guarantees. Besides, when unlearnable examples are mixed with clean data, as is often the case in practice, their unlearnability disappears. In this work, we propose a novel approach to constructing unlearnable examples by systematically maximising the Bayes error, a measurement of irreducible classification error. We develop an optimisation-based approach and provide an efficient solution using projected gradient ascent. Our method provably increases the Bayes error and remains effective when the unlearning examples are mixed with clean samples. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model architectures are consistent with our theoretical analysis and show that our approach can restrict data learnability, effectively in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6e05\u6d01\u6837\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6e05\u6d01\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9519\u8bef\uff08\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\uff09\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9650\u5236\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6e05\u6d01\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9519\u8bef\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

We present EAGLE, a novel framework that leverages episodic appearance- and geometry-aware memory to achieve unified 2D-3D visual query localization in egocentric vision. Inspired by avian memory consolidation, EAGLE synergistically integrates segmentation guided by an appearance-aware meta-learning memory (AMM), with tracking driven by a geometry-aware localization memory (GLM). This memory consolidation mechanism, through structured appearance and geometry memory banks, stores high-confidence retrieval samples, effectively supporting both long- and short-term modeling of target appearance variations. This enables precise contour delineation with robust spatial discrimination, leading to significantly improved retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, by integrating the VQL-2D output with a visual geometry grounded Transformer (VGGT), we achieve a efficient unification of 2D and 3D tasks, enabling rapid and accurate back-projection into 3D space.

Road-Style Adversarial Creation Attack for Visual 3D Detection in Autonomous Driving", "comment": "Accepted by the AAAI 2026 (Main Track)", "summary": "Modern autonomous driving (AD) systems leverage 3D object detection to perceive foreground objects in 3D environments for subsequent prediction and planning. Visual 3D detection based on RGB cameras provides a cost-effective solution compared to the LiDAR paradigm. While achieving promising detection accuracy, current deep neural network-based models remain highly susceptible to adversarial examples. The underlying safety concerns motivate us to investigate realistic adversarial attacks in AD scenarios. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of placing adversarial posters on the road surface to induce hallucinations in the detector. However, the unnatural appearance of the posters makes them easily noticeable by humans, and their fixed content can be readily targeted and defended. To address these limitations, we propose the AdvRoad to generate diverse road-style adversarial posters. The adversaries have naturalistic appearances resembling the road surface while compromising the detector to perceive non-existent objects at the attack locations.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have enabled virtual screening methods that reduce costs and improve efficiency. However, the growing complexity of these tools has limited their accessibility to wet-lab researchers. Multi-agent systems offer a promising solution by combining the interpretability of LLMs with the precision of specialized models and tools. In this work, we present MADD, a multi-agent system that builds and executes customized hit identification pipelines from natural language queries. MADD employs four coordinated agents to handle key subtasks in de novo compound generation and screening. We evaluate MADD across seven drug discovery cases and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing LLM-based solutions. Using MADD, we pioneer the application of AI-first drug design to five biological targets and release the identified hit molecules.

This paper introduces TRACE (Trajectory-based Reward for Agent Collaboration Estimation), a novel reward signal derived from the geometric properties of a dialogue's embedding trajectory--a concept we term 'conversational geometry'. Our central finding is that a reward model trained only on these structural signals achieves a pairwise accuracy (68.20%) comparable to a powerful LLM baseline that analyzes the full transcript (70.04%). Furthermore, a hybrid model combining interaction dynamics with textual analysis achieves the highest performance (80.17%), demonstrating their complementary nature.

This motivated Imaginary Supervised Object Detection (ISOD), where models train on synthetic images and test on real images. However, existing methods face three limitations: (1) synthetic datasets suffer from simplistic prompts, poor image quality, and weak supervision; (2) DETR-based detectors, due to their random query initialization, struggle with slow convergence and overfitting to synthetic patterns, hindering real-world generalization; (3) uniform denoising pressure promotes model overfitting to pseudo-label noise. We propose Cascade HQP-DETR to address these limitations. First, we introduce a high-quality data pipeline using LLaMA-3, Flux, and Grounding DINO to generate the FluxVOC and FluxCOCO datasets, advancing ISOD from weak to full supervision. Second, our High-Quality Proposal guided query encoding initializes object queries with image-specific priors from SAM-generated proposals and RoI-pooled features, accelerating convergence while steering the model to learn transferable features instead of overfitting to synthetic patterns. Third, our cascade denoising algorithm dynamically adjusts training weights through progressively increasing IoU thresholds across decoder layers, guiding the model to learn robust boundaries from reliable visual cues rather than overfitting to noisy labels.

While von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions offer a theoretically grounded alternative on the sphere, their reliance on Bessel functions and rejection sampling hinders practical adoption. We propose \\textbf{Geometric Action Control (GAC)}, a novel action generation paradigm that preserves the geometric benefits of spherical distributions while \\textit{simplifying computation}. GAC decomposes action generation into a direction vector and a learnable concentration parameter, enabling efficient interpolation between deterministic actions and uniform spherical noise. This design reduces parameter count from \\(2d\\) to \\(d+1\\), and avoids the \\(O(dk)\\) complexity of vMF rejection sampling, achieving simple \\(O(d)\\) operations. Empirically, GAC consistently matches or exceeds state-of-the-art methods across six MuJoCo benchmarks, achieving 37.6\\% improvement over SAC on Ant-v4 and the best results on 4 out of 6 tasks. Our ablation studies reveal that both \\textbf{spherical normalization} and \\textbf{adaptive concentration control} are essential to GAC's success. These findings suggest that robust and efficient continuous control does not require complex distributions, but a principled respect for the geometry of action spaces.

In particular, the impact of shortcut learning, where models rely on spurious correlations instead of capturing causal task-relevant features, has received limited attention. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth study to assess how detectors are influenced by potential shortcuts based on textual features, which are most susceptible to manipulation by social bots. We design a series of shortcut scenarios by constructing spurious associations between user labels and superficial textual cues to evaluate model robustness. Results show that shifts in irrelevant feature distributions significantly degrade social bot detector performance, with an average relative accuracy drop of 32\\% in the baseline models. To tackle this challenge, we propose mitigation strategies based on large language models, leveraging counterfactual data augmentation. These methods mitigate the problem from data and model perspectives across three levels, including data distribution at both the individual user text and overall dataset levels, as well as the model's ability to extract causal information.

This white paper proposes a novel, comprehensive framework of eleven outcome-based, task-agnostic performance metrics for AI agents that transcend domain boundaries. These metrics are designed to enable organizations to evaluate agents based on the quality of their decisions, their degree of autonomy, their adaptability to new challenges, and the tangible business value they deliver, regardless of the underlying model architecture or specific use case. We introduce metrics such as Goal Completion Rate (GCR), Autonomy Index (AIx), Multi-Step Task Resilience (MTR), and Business Impact Efficiency (BIE). Through a large-scale simulated experiment involving four distinct agent architectures (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, Tool-Augmented, Hybrid) across five diverse domains (Healthcare, Finance, Marketing, Legal, and Customer Service), we demonstrate the framework's efficacy. Our results reveal significant performance trade-offs between different agent designs, highlighting the Hybrid Agent as the most consistently high-performing model across the majority of our proposed metrics, achieving an average Goal Completion Rate of 88.8\\% and the highest Return on Investment (ROI).

While prior research has emphasized algorithmic performance and visual fidelity, the perceptual quality of 3DGS-rendered content, especially under varying reconstruction conditions, remains largely underexplored. In practice, factors such as viewpoint sparsity, limited training iterations, point downsampling, noise, and color distortions can significantly degrade visual quality, yet their perceptual impact has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we present 3DGS-QA, the first subjective quality assessment dataset for 3DGS. It comprises 225 degraded reconstructions across 15 object types, enabling a controlled investigation of common distortion factors. Based on this dataset, we introduce a no-reference quality prediction model that directly operates on native 3D Gaussian primitives, without requiring rendered images or ground-truth references. Our model extracts spatial and photometric cues from the Gaussian representation to estimate perceived quality in a structure-aware manner. We further benchmark existing quality assessment methods, spanning both traditional and learning-based approaches. Experimental results show that our method consistently achieves superior performance, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness for 3DGS content evaluation.

To address these challenges, task-vector-based methods have been explored by inserting compact representations of many-shot in-context demonstrations into model activations. However, existing task-vector-based methods either overlook the importance of where to insert task vectors or struggle to determine suitable values for each location. To this end, we propose a novel Sensitivity-aware Task Vector insertion framework (STV) to figure out where and what to insert. Our key insight is that activation deltas across query-context pairs exhibit consistent structural patterns, providing a reliable cue for insertion. Based on the identified sensitive-aware locations, we construct a pre-clustered activation bank for each location by clustering the activation values, and then apply reinforcement learning to choose the most suitable one to insert. We evaluate STV across a range of multimodal models (e.g., Qwen-VL, Idefics-2) and tasks (e.g., VizWiz, OK-VQA), demonstrating its effectiveness and showing consistent improvements over previous task-vector-based methods with strong generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u63d2\u5165\u6846\u67b6(STV)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u67e5\u8be2-\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5dee\u503c\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u63d2\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u503c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u63d2\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u96be\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u5408\u9002\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u503c\u3002", "method": "STV\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u67e5\u8be2-\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5dee\u503c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u786e\u5b9a\u654f\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u805a\u7c7b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u5408\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b(Qwen-VL, Idefics-2)\u548c\u4efb\u52a1(VizWiz, OK-VQA)\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSTV\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "STV\u901a\u8fc7\u611f\u77e5\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u786e\u5b9a\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5411\u91cf\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6210\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

At ingestion time, S-RAG constructs a structured representation of the corpus; at inference time, it translates natural-language queries into formal queries over said representation. To validate our approach and promote further research in this area, we introduce two new datasets of aggregative queries: HOTELS and WORLD CUP.

Most existing GraphRAG efforts focus on Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graphs, relying on triple representations and SPARQL queries. However, the potential of Cypher and Labeled Property Graph (LPG) databases to serve as scalable and effective reasoning engines within GraphRAG pipelines remains underexplored in current research literature. To fill this gap, we propose Multi-Agent GraphRAG, a modular LLM agentic system for text-to-Cypher query generation serving as a natural language interface to LPG-based graph data. Our proof-of-concept system features an LLM-based workflow for automated Cypher queries generation and execution, using Memgraph as the graph database backend. Iterative content-aware correction and normalization, reinforced by an aggregated feedback loop, ensures both semantic and syntactic refinement of generated queries.

Correspondingly, existing research in this field has been limited to word and alphabet level detection. In this work, we introduce Bangla-SGP, a novel parallel dataset consisting of 1,000 human-annotated sentence-gloss pairs which was augmented with around 3,000 synthetically generated pairs using syntactic and morphological rules through a rule-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The gloss sequences of the spoken Bangla sentences are made up of individual glosses which are Bangla sign supported words and serve as an intermediate representation for a continuous sign. Our dataset consists of 1000 high quality Bangla sentences that are manually annotated into a gloss sequence by a professional signer. The augmentation process incorporates rule-based linguistic strategies and prompt engineering techniques that we have adopted by critically analyzing our human annotated sentence-gloss pairs and by working closely with our professional signer. Furthermore, we fine-tune several transformer-based models such as mBart50, Google mT5, GPT4.1-nano and evaluate their sentence-to-gloss translation performance using BLEU scores, based on these evaluation metrics we compare the model's gloss-translation consistency across our dataset and the RWTH-PHOENIX-2014T benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Bangla-SGP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1000\u4e2a\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c3000\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u8bed\u53e5-\u8bcd\u6c47\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u4e2aTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90NLP\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u8bcd\u548c\u5b57\u6bcd\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaBangla-SGP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1000\u4e2a\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u53e5-\u8bcd\u6c47\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684RAG\u7ba1\u9053\u7ed3\u5408\u53e5\u6cd5\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u89c4\u5219\u751f\u62103000\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03mBart50\u3001mT5\u3001GPT4.1-nano\u7b49Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528BLEU\u8bc4\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u591a\u79cdTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53e5-\u8bcd\u6c47\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u4e0eRWTH-PHOENIX-2014T\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5b5f\u52a0\u62c9\u624b\u8bed\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u589e\u5f3a\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u624b\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

We address this by proposing DiagramIR: an automatic and scalable evaluation pipeline for geometric figures. Our method relies on intermediate representations (IRs) of LaTeX TikZ code. We compare our pipeline to other evaluation baselines such as LLM-as-a-Judge, showing that our approach has higher agreement with human raters.

A common approach to localize objects across multiple sizes is to merge backbone features of different resolutions. Furthermore, to enable small object detection in densely populated regions, the input image is commonly upsampled and tiling is applied to cope with the increased computational and memory requirements. Because of these ad-hoc solutions, existing counters struggle with images containing diverse-sized objects and densely populated regions of small objects.

Beyond improving abilities, these detailed reasoning traces also create a new opportunity for AI safety, CoT Monitorability: monitoring potential model misbehavior, such as the use of shortcuts or sycophancy, through their chain-of-thought (CoT) during decision-making. However, two key fundamental challenges arise when attempting to build more effective monitors through CoT analysis. First, as prior research on CoT faithfulness has pointed out, models do not always truthfully represent their internal decision-making in the generated reasoning. Second, monitors themselves may be either overly sensitive or insufficiently sensitive, and can potentially be deceived by models' long, elaborate reasoning traces. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of the challenges and potential of CoT monitorability. Motivated by two fundamental challenges we mentioned before, we structure our study around two central perspectives: (i) verbalization: to what extent do LRMs faithfully verbalize the true factors guiding their decisions in the CoT, and (ii) monitor reliability: to what extent can misbehavior be reliably detected by a CoT-based monitor? Specifically, we provide empirical evidence and correlation analyses between verbalization quality, monitor reliability, and LLM performance across mathematical, scientific, and ethical domains. Then we further investigate how different CoT intervention methods, designed to improve reasoning efficiency or performance, will affect monitoring effectiveness. Finally, we propose MoME, a new paradigm in which LLMs monitor other models' misbehavior through their CoT and provide structured judgments along with supporting evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b(LRMs)\u901a\u8fc7\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe(CoT)\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5\u8bed\u8a00\u5316\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MoME\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u8ba9LLMs\u76f8\u4e92\u76d1\u63a7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\uff0c\u5176\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3aAI\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u2014\u2014CoT\u53ef\u76d1\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u76d1\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f7f\u7528\u6377\u5f84\u6216\u8c04\u5a9a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u4f46\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u76d1\u63a7\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u8fbe\u5185\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u4e8e\u654f\u611f\u6216\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6b3a\u9a97\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56f4\u7ed5\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u89c6\u89d2\u5c55\u5f00\uff1a(i)\u8bed\u8a00\u5316\uff1a\u8bc4\u4f30LRMs\u5728CoT\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u8fbe\u51b3\u7b56\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b(ii)\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8eCoT\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u8de8\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540cCoT\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u76d1\u63a7\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u51faMoME\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u76d1\u63a7\u5668\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548cLLM\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u540cCoT\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u76d1\u63a7\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51faMoME\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8ba9LLMs\u901a\u8fc7CoT\u76d1\u63a7\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5224\u65ad\u4e0e\u652f\u6301\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the moral response of LLMs to persona role-play, prompting a LLM to assume a specific character. Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), we introduce a benchmark that quantifies two properties: moral susceptibility and moral robustness, defined from the variability of MFQ scores across and within personas, respectively. We find that, for moral robustness, model family accounts for most of the variance, while model size shows no systematic effect. The Claude family is, by a significant margin, the most robust, followed by Gemini and GPT-4 models, with other families exhibiting lower robustness. In contrast, moral susceptibility exhibits a mild family effect but a clear within-family size effect, with larger variants being more susceptible. Moreover, robustness and susceptibility are positively correlated, an association that is more pronounced at the family level. Additionally, we present moral foundation profiles for models without persona role-play and for personas averaged across models. Together, these analyses provide a systematic view of how persona conditioning shapes moral behavior in large language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u5377\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u4e2d\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5bf9\u9053\u5fb7\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u9053\u5fb7\u6613\u611f\u6027\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0cClaude\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e5\u76ca\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u8f6c\u6362\u9053\u5fb7\u5224\u65ad\u53d8\u5f97\u5341\u5206\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9LLM\u9053\u5fb7\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9053\u5fb7\u57fa\u7840\u95ee\u5377(MFQ)\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9LLM\u626e\u6f14\u7279\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\uff1a\u9053\u5fb7\u6613\u611f\u6027(\u8de8\u89d2\u8272MFQ\u5206\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027)\u548c\u9053\u5fb7\u9c81\u68d2\u6027(\u89d2\u8272\u5185MFQ\u5206\u6570\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027)\u3002", "result": "\u9053\u5fb7\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u65e0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f71\u54cd\uff1bClaude\u5bb6\u65cf\u6700\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662fGemini\u548cGPT-4\u3002\u9053\u5fb7\u6613\u611f\u6027\u5448\u73b0\u8f7b\u5fae\u5bb6\u65cf\u6548\u5e94\u4f46\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5bb6\u65cf\u5185\u5927\u5c0f\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u6613\u611f\u3002\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6613\u611f\u6027\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6761\u4ef6\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a7\u5236LLM\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, traditional radar-based heartbeat sensing methods face performance degradation due to noise. Learning-based radar methods achieve better noise robustness but require costly labeled signals for supervised training. To overcome these limitations, we propose the first unsupervised framework for radar-based heartbeat sensing via Augmented Pseudo-Label and Noise Contrast (Radar-APLANC). We propose to use both the heartbeat range and noise range within the radar range matrix to construct the positive and negative samples, respectively, for improved noise robustness. Our Noise-Contrastive Triplet (NCT) loss only utilizes positive samples, negative samples, and pseudo-label signals generated by the traditional radar method, thereby avoiding dependence on expensive ground-truth physiological signals.

Following the growing scientific interest in mechanistic interpretability, recent work encoded refusal behavior as a single direction in the model's latent space; e.g., computed as the difference between the centroids of harmful and harmless prompt representations. However, emerging evidence suggests that concepts in LLMs often appear to be encoded as a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the high-dimensional latent space. Motivated by these findings, we propose a novel method leveraging Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to extract multiple refusal directions. To this end, we first prove that SOMs generalize the prior work's difference-in-means technique. We then train SOMs on harmful prompt representations to identify multiple neurons. By subtracting the centroid of harmless representations from each neuron, we derive a set of multiple directions expressing the refusal concept. We validate our method on an extensive experimental setup, demonstrating that ablating multiple directions from models' internals outperforms not only the single-direction baseline but also specialized jailbreak algorithms, leading to an effective suppression of refusal.

Prior work proposes recurrent transformers, which allocate a fixed number of extra iterations per token to improve generation quality. After the first, standard forward pass, instead of verbalization, last-layer hidden states are fed back as inputs for additional iterations to refine token predictions. Yet we identify a latent overthinking phenomenon: easy token predictions that are already correct after the first pass are sometimes revised into errors in additional iterations. To address this, we propose Think-at-Hard (TaH), a dynamic latent thinking method that iterates deeper only at hard tokens. It employs a lightweight neural decider to trigger latent iterations only at tokens that are likely incorrect after the standard forward pass. During latent iterations, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules shift the LLM objective from general next-token prediction to focused hard-token refinement. We further introduce a duo-causal attention mechanism that extends attention from the token sequence dimension to an additional iteration depth dimension. This enables cross-iteration information flow while maintaining full sequential parallelism. Experiments show that TaH boosts LLM reasoning performance across five challenging benchmarks while maintaining the same parameter count. Compared with baselines that iterate twice for all output tokens, TaH delivers 8.1-11.3% accuracy gains while exempting 94% of tokens from the second iteration. Against strong single-iteration Qwen3 models finetuned with the same data, it also delivers 4.0-5.0% accuracy gains. When allowing less than 3% additional parameters from LoRA and the iteration decider, the gains increase to 8.5-12.6% and 5.3-5.4%, respectively.

However, the extent to which these models have a semantic understanding of the images they generate is not well understood. In this work, we investigate whether the internal representations used by these models during text-to-image generation contain semantic information that is meaningful to humans. To do so, we perform probing on Stable Diffusion with simple regression layers that predict semantic attributes for objects and evaluate these predictions against human annotations. Surprisingly, we find that this success can actually be attributed to the text encoding occurring in CLIP rather than the reverse diffusion process. We demonstrate that groups of specific semantic attributes have markedly different decoding accuracy than the average, and are thus represented to different degrees. Finally, we show that attributes become more difficult to disambiguate from one another during the inverse diffusion process, further demonstrating the strongest semantic representation of object attributes in CLIP. We conclude that the separately trained CLIP vision-language model is what determines the human-like semantic representation, and that the diffusion process instead takes the role of a visual decoder.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0Stable Diffusion\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81eaCLIP\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u800c\u975e\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\uff0cCLIP\u8d1f\u8d23\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u800c\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5145\u5f53\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u662f\u5426\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Stable Diffusion\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u5c42\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u610f\u5916\u53d1\u73b0\u6210\u529f\u53ef\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u800c\u975e\u53cd\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u7fa4\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u5728\u9006\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c5e\u6027\u95f4\u533a\u5206\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684CLIP\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e3b\u8981\u626e\u6f14\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002"}}

We distinguish between behavioral faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and output) and perceptual faithfulness (alignment between reasoning and input), and introduce FaithEval for quantifying step-level and chain-level faithfulness by evaluating whether each claimed object is visually supported by the image. Building on these insights, we propose FaithAct, a faithfulness-first planning and acting framework that enforces evidential grounding at every reasoning step. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FaithAct improves perceptual faithfulness by up to 26% without degrading task accuracy compared to prompt-based and tool-augmented baselines. Our analysis shows that treating faithfulness as a guiding principle not only mitigates hallucination but also leads to more stable reasoning trajectories.

Existing metrics rely on global embeddings or coarse VLM prompting, failing to capture fine-grained identity changes and providing limited diagnostic insight. We introduce Beyond the Pixels, a hierarchical evaluation framework that decomposes identity assessment into feature-level transformations. Our approach guides VLMs through structured reasoning by (1) hierarchically decomposing subjects into (type, style) -> attribute -> feature decision tree, and (2) prompting for concrete transformations rather than abstract similarity scores. This decomposition grounds VLM analysis in verifiable visual evidence, reducing hallucinations and improving consistency.

To develop and evaluate effective morphing attack detection (MAD) systems, we need access to high-quality, realistic morphed images that reflect the challenges posed in real-world scenarios. However, existing morph generation methods often produce images that are blurry, riddled with artifacts, or poorly constructed making them easy to detect and not representative of the most dangerous attacks. In this work, we introduce StableMorph, a novel approach that generates highly realistic, artifact-free morphed face images using modern diffusion-based image synthesis. Unlike prior methods, StableMorph produces full-head images with sharp details, avoids common visual flaws, and offers unmatched control over visual attributes. Through extensive evaluation, we show that StableMorph images not only rival or exceed the quality of genuine face images but also maintain a strong ability to fool face recognition systems posing a greater challenge to existing MAD solutions and setting a new standard for morph quality in research and operational testing. StableMorph improves the evaluation of biometric security by creating more realistic and effective attacks and supports the development of more robust detection systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "StableMorph\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4eba\u8138\u53d8\u5f62\u653b\u51fb\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u903c\u771f\u3001\u65e0\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u5168\u5934\u53d8\u5f62\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6b3a\u9a97\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5f62\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53d8\u5f62\u653b\u51fb\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u6709\u4f2a\u5f71\u6216\u8d28\u91cf\u4f4e\u52a3\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ee3\u8868\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6700\u5371\u9669\u7684\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u66f4\u903c\u771f\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "StableMorph\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5168\u5934\u53d8\u5f62\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5e38\u89c1\u89c6\u89c9\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cStableMorph\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u8138\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u9762\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709MAD\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6784\u6210\u66f4\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "StableMorph\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u5efa\u66f4\u903c\u771f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u8bc6\u522b\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

While vendors release improved LLM versions, major releases are costly, infrequent, and difficult to tailor to customer needs, leaving released models with known safety gaps. Unlike full-model fine-tuning or major version updates, our method enables rapid remediation by prepending a compact, learnable prefix to an existing model. This \"patch\" introduces only 0.003% additional parameters, yet reliably steers model behavior toward that of a safer reference model. Across three critical domains (toxicity mitigation, bias reduction, and harmfulness refusal) policy patches achieve safety improvements comparable to next-generation safety-aligned models while preserving fluency.

In this work, we introduce a new dataset focused on a novel and realistic presentation attack instrument called Nylon Face Masks (NFMs), designed to simulate advanced 3D spoofing scenarios. NFMs are particularly concerning due to their elastic structure and photorealistic appearance, which enable them to closely mimic the victim's facial geometry when worn by an attacker. To reflect real-world smartphone-based usage conditions, we collected the dataset using an iPhone 11 Pro, capturing 3,760 bona fide samples from 100 subjects and 51,281 NFM attack samples across four distinct presentation scenarios involving both humans and mannequins. We benchmark the dataset using five state-of-the-art PAD methods to evaluate their robustness under unseen attack conditions.

From researchers choosing which problems to tackle next, to students deciding which ones to engage with, people's choices are often guided by judgments about how interesting or challenging problems are likely to be. As AI systems, such as LLMs, increasingly participate in mathematics with people -- whether for advanced research or education -- it becomes important to understand how well their judgments align with human ones. Our work examines this alignment through two empirical studies of human and LLM assessment of mathematical interestingness and difficulty, spanning a range of mathematical experience. We study two groups: participants from a crowdsourcing platform and International Math Olympiad competitors. We show that while many LLMs appear to broadly agree with human notions of interestingness, they mostly do not capture the distribution observed in human judgments. Moreover, most LLMs only somewhat align with why humans find certain math problems interesting, showing weak correlation with human-selected interestingness rationales. Together, our findings highlight both the promises and limitations of current LLMs in capturing human interestingness judgments for mathematical AI thought partnerships.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u867d\u7136\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u80fd\u8ba4\u540c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u7406\u7531\u4ec5\u5448\u73b0\u5f31\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982LLM\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u53c2\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u662f\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u5951\u5408\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5f80\u5f80\u53d7\u5230\u95ee\u9898\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u6311\u6218\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9879\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u5b66\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u4e24\u7ec4\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff1a\u4f17\u5305\u5e73\u53f0\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u6570\u5b66\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u7ade\u8d5b\u9009\u624b\u3002", "result": "\u867d\u7136\u8bb8\u591aLLM\u5927\u4f53\u4e0a\u8ba4\u540c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6570LLM\u4ec5\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u7406\u7531\u76f8\u7b26\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u7406\u7531\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u5b66\u8da3\u5473\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u524d\u666f\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b66AI\u601d\u60f3\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

This work is part of the Zerovision project. Code available at: https://github.com/ertis-research/zerovision", "summary": "Foam formation in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WTPs) is a major challenge that can reduce treatment efficiency and increase costs. The ability to automatically examine changes in real-time with respect to the percentage of foam can be of great benefit to the plant. However, large amounts of labeled data are required to train standard Machine Learning (ML) models. The development of these systems is slow due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of labeled data. Additionally, the development is often hindered by the fact that different WTPs do not share their data due to privacy concerns. This paper proposes a new framework to address these challenges by combining Federated Learning (FL) with the state-of-the-art base model for image segmentation, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). The FL paradigm enables collaborative model training across multiple WTPs without centralizing sensitive operational data, thereby ensuring privacy. The framework accelerates training convergence and improves segmentation performance even with limited local datasets by leveraging SAM2's strong pre-trained weights for initialization. The methodology involves fine-tuning SAM2 on distributed clients (edge nodes) using the Flower framework, where a central Fog server orchestrates the process by aggregating model weights without accessing private data. The model was trained and validated using various data collections, including real-world images captured at a WTPs in Granada, Spain, a synthetically generated foam dataset, and images from publicly available datasets to improve generalization. This research offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-aware solution for automatic foam tracking in WTPs.

These developments point toward the emergence of video foundation models that function not only as visual generators but also as implicit world models, models that simulate the physical dynamics, agent-environment interactions, and task planning that govern real or imagined worlds. This survey provides a systematic overview of this evolution, conceptualizing modern video foundation models as the combination of two core components: an implicit world model and a video renderer. The world model encodes structured knowledge about the world, including physical laws, interaction dynamics, and agent behavior. It serves as a latent simulation engine that enables coherent visual reasoning, long-term temporal consistency, and goal-driven planning. The video renderer transforms this latent simulation into realistic visual observations, effectively producing videos as a \"window\" into the simulated world. We trace the progression of video generation through four generations, in which the core capabilities advance step by step, ultimately culminating in a world model, built upon a video generation model, that embodies intrinsic physical plausibility, real-time multimodal interaction, and planning capabilities spanning multiple spatiotemporal scales. For each generation, we define its core characteristics, highlight representative works, and examine their application domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and interactive gaming. Finally, we discuss open challenges and design principles for next-generation world models, including the role of agent intelligence in shaping and evaluating these systems.

PEOD contains 130+ spatiotemporal-aligned sequences and 340k manual bounding boxes, with 57% of data captured under low-light, overexposure, and high-speed motion. Furthermore, we benchmark 14 methods across three input configurations (Event-based, RGB-based, and Event-RGB fusion) on PEOD. On the full test set and normal subset, fusion-based models achieve the excellent performance. However, in illumination challenge subset, the top event-based model outperforms all fusion models, while fusion models still outperform their RGB-based counterparts, indicating limits of existing fusion methods when the frame modality is severely degraded.

To address the scarcity of annotated data, a popular solution is unsupervised domain adaptation, which has been extensively studied in unimodal settings yet remains less explored in multimodal settings. In this paper, we investigate heterogeneous multimodal domain adaptation, where the primary challenge is the varying domain shifts of different modalities from the source to the target domain. We first introduce the information bottleneck method to learn representations for each modality independently, and then match the source and target domains in the representation space with correlation alignment. To balance the domain alignment of all modalities, we formulate the problem as a multi-objective task, aiming for a Pareto optimal solution. By exploiting the properties specific to our model, the problem can be simplified to a quadratic programming problem. Further approximation yields a closed-form solution, leading to an efficient modality-balanced multimodal domain adaptation algorithm.

Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (FR-IQA) methods fail under misalignment, while No-Reference (NR-IQA) methods struggle with generalization. In this work, we introduce a Non-Aligned Reference (NAR-IQA) framework tailored for NVS, where it is assumed that the reference view shares partial scene content but lacks pixel-level alignment. We constructed a large-scale image dataset containing synthetic distortions targeting Temporal Regions of Interest (TROI) to train our NAR-IQA model. Our model is built on a contrastive learning framework that incorporates LoRA-enhanced DINOv2 embeddings and is guided by supervision from existing IQA methods. We train exclusively on synthetically generated distortions, deliberately avoiding overfitting to specific real NVS samples and thereby enhancing the model's generalization capability. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art FR-IQA, NR-IQA, and NAR-IQA methods, achieving robust performance on both aligned and non-aligned references. We also conducted a novel user study to gather data on human preferences when viewing non-aligned references in NVS. We find strong correlation between our proposed quality prediction model and the collected subjective ratings.

However, current LULC models are typically developed for a specific modality and a fixed class taxonomy, limiting their generability and broader applicability. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) offer promising opportunities for building universal models. Yet, task-agnostic FMs often require fine-tuning for downstream applications, whereas task-specific FMs rely on massive amounts of labeled data for training, which is costly and impractical in the remote sensing (RS) domain. To address these challenges, we propose LandSegmenter, an LULC FM framework that resolves three-stage challenges at the input, model, and output levels. From the input side, to alleviate the heavy demand on labeled data for FM training, we introduce LAnd Segment (LAS), a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-source dataset built primarily with globally sampled weak labels from existing LULC products. LAS provides a scalable, cost-effective alternative to manual annotation, enabling large-scale FM training across diverse LULC domains. For model architecture, LandSegmenter integrates an RS-specific adapter for cross-modal feature extraction and a text encoder for semantic awareness enhancement. At the output stage, we introduce a class-wise confidence-guided fusion strategy to mitigate semantic omissions and further improve LandSegmenter's zero-shot performance. We evaluate LandSegmenter on six precisely annotated LULC datasets spanning diverse modalities and class taxonomies. Extensive transfer learning and zero-shot experiments demonstrate that LandSegmenter achieves competitive or superior performance, particularly in zero-shot settings when transferred to unseen datasets.

While recent diffusion-based methods have outperformed GAN-based approaches, existing techniques, such as the diffusion-based relighting framework IC-Light, still fall short in producing shadows with both high appearance realism and geometric precision, especially in composite images. To address these limitations, we propose a novel shadow generation framework based on a Keypoints Linear Model (KPLM) and a Shadow Triangle Algorithm (STA). KPLM models articulated human bodies using nine keypoints and one bounding block, enabling physically plausible shadow projection and dynamic shading across joints, thereby enhancing visual realism. STA further improves geometric accuracy by computing shadow angles, lengths, and spatial positions through explicit geometric formulations.

Considering the data heterogeneity issues across distributed nodes, we introduce two key components to ensure the effective learning of DistZSL: a cross-node attribute regularizer and a global attribute-to-visual consensus. Our proposed cross-node attribute regularizer enforces the distances between attribute features to be similar across different nodes. In this manner, the overall attribute feature space would be stable during learning, and thus facilitate the establishment of visual-to-attribute(V2A) relationships. Then, we introduce the global attribute-tovisual consensus to mitigate biased V2A mappings learned from individual nodes. Specifically, we enforce the bilateral mapping between the attribute and visual feature distributions to be consistent across different nodes.

These descriptions condition the diffusion model, learning a robust normal image feature representation for multi-class anomaly detection. Our method achieves competitive performance, improving the pixel-level Per-Region-Overlap (PRO) metric by up to 25 points on the Real-IAD dataset and 8 points on the COCO-AD dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches.

Achieving high detection performance requires that the estimated quality closely aligns with the actual localization accuracy. To this end, existing approaches predict the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the predicted and ground-truth (GT) boxes as a proxy for localization quality. However, box-level IoU prediction suffers from a structural coupling issue: since the predicted box is derived from the detector's internal estimation of the GT box, the predicted IoU--based on their similarity--can be overestimated for poorly localized boxes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Pixel-level Quality Assessment (PQA) framework, which replaces box-level IoU prediction with the integration of pixel-level spatial consistency. PQA measures the alignment between each pixel's relative position to the predicted box and its corresponding position to the GT box. By operating at the pixel level, PQA avoids directly comparing the predicted box with the estimated GT box, thereby eliminating the inherent similarity bias in box-level IoU prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a new integration metric that aggregates pixel-level spatial consistency into a unified quality score, yielding a more accurate approximation of the actual localization quality. Extensive experiments on HRSC2016 and DOTA demonstrate that PQA can be seamlessly integrated into various oriented object detectors, consistently improving performance (e.g., +5.96% AP$_{50:95}$ on Rotated RetinaNet and +2.32% on STD).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30(PQA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u7ea7IoU\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9a\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u8026\u5408\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b9a\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u7ea7IoU\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u7531\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u6e90\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6846\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684IoU\u9884\u6d4b\u4f1a\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u6846\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u4f30\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30(PQA)\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1)\u7528\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u96c6\u6210\u66ff\u4ee3\u6846\u7ea7IoU\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2)\u6d4b\u91cf\u6bcf\u4e2a\u50cf\u7d20\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6846\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\uff1b3)\u901a\u8fc7\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\u907f\u514d\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u4e0e\u4f30\u8ba1\u771f\u5b9e\u6846\uff1b4)\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6307\u6807\u5c06\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728HRSC2016\u548cDOTA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPQA\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5404\u79cd\u5b9a\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u5728Rotated RetinaNet\u4e0a\u63d0\u53475.96% AP_50:95\uff0c\u5728STD\u4e0a\u63d0\u53472.32%\u3002", "conclusion": "PQA\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u5c42\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u6846\u7ea7IoU\u9884\u6d4b\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8026\u5408\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recent advances in visual language models (VLMs) highlight the potential of automatic UI coding, but current approaches face two key limitations: multimodal coding capabilities remain underdeveloped, and single-turn paradigms make little use of iterative visual feedback. We address these challenges with an interactive UI-to-code paradigm that better reflects real-world workflows and raises the upper bound of achievable performance. Under this paradigm, we present UI2Code$^\\text{N}$, a visual language model trained through staged pretraining, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to achieve foundational improvements in multimodal coding. The model unifies three key capabilities: UI-to-code generation, UI editing, and UI polishing. We further explore test-time scaling for interactive generation, enabling systematic use of multi-turn feedback. Experiments on UI-to-code and UI polishing benchmarks show that UI2Code$^\\text{N}$ establishes a new state of the art among open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models such as Claude-4-Sonnet and GPT-5.

Existing works primarily follow the localize-editing paradigm, focusing on independent object localization and editing while neglecting critical inter-object interactions. However, this work points out that the neglected attention entanglements in inter-object conflict regions, inherently hinder disentangled multi-object editing, leading to either inter-object editing leakage or intra-object editing constraints. We thereby propose a novel multi-layer disentangled editing framework LayerEdit, a training-free method which, for the first time, through precise object-layered decomposition and coherent fusion, enables conflict-free object-layered editing. Specifically, LayerEdit introduces a novel \"decompose-editingfusion\" framework, consisting of: (1) Conflict-aware Layer Decomposition module, which utilizes an attention-aware IoU scheme and time-dependent region removing, to enhance conflict awareness and suppression for layer decomposition. (2) Object-layered Editing module, to establish coordinated intra-layer text guidance and cross-layer geometric mapping, achieving disentangled semantic and structural modifications. (3) Transparency-guided Layer Fusion module, to facilitate structure-coherent inter-object layer fusion through precise transparency guidance learning.

However, when facing extreme conditions (e.g., insufficient light, fierce camera motion), most existing methods suffer from significant information loss of RGB, severely damaging segmentation results. Several researches exploit the high-speed and high-dynamic event modality as a complement, but event and RGB are naturally heterogeneous, which leads to feature-level mismatch and inferior optimization of existing multi-modality methods. Different from these researches, we delve into the edge secret of both modalities for resilient fusion and propose a novel Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework to unify the multi-modality heterogeneous features with latent edge cues. In this framework, we first propose Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding, which obtains uncertainty indicators while realigning event-RGB features into unified semantic space guided by re-coded distribution, and transfers event-RGB distributions into re-coded features by utilizing a pre-established edge dictionary as clues. We then propose Re-coded Consolidation and Uncertainty Optimization, which utilize re-coded edge features and uncertainty indicators to solve the heterogeneous event-RGB fusion issues under extreme conditions. We establish two synthetic and one real-world event-RGB semantic segmentation datasets for extreme scenario comparisons. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a 2.55% mIoU on our proposed DERS-XS, and possesses superior resilience under spatial occlusion.

However, existing fusion methods are often either highly task-specific, or general frameworks that apply uniform strategies across diverse tasks, ignoring their distinct fusion mechanisms. To address this issue, we propose a mechanism-aware unsupervised general image fusion (MAUGIF) method based on dual cross-image autoencoders. Initially, we introduce a classification of additive and multiplicative fusion according to the inherent mechanisms of different fusion tasks. Then, dual encoders map source images into a shared latent space, capturing common content while isolating modality-specific details. During the decoding phase, dual decoders act as feature injectors, selectively reintegrating the unique characteristics of each modality into the shared content for reconstruction. The modality-specific features are injected into the source image in the fusion process, generating the fused image that integrates information from both modalities. The architecture of decoders varies according to their fusion mechanisms, enhancing both performance and interpretability. Extensive experiments are conducted on diverse fusion tasks to validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method.

State-of-the-art multi-view methods learn to fuse predictions across views by training on large annotated datasets, leading to poor generalization when the test scenario differs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkelSplat, a novel framework for multi-view 3D human pose estimation based on differentiable Gaussian rendering. Human pose is modeled as a skeleton of 3D Gaussians, one per joint, optimized via differentiable rendering to enable seamless fusion of arbitrary camera views without 3D ground-truth supervision. Since Gaussian Splatting was originally designed for dense scene reconstruction, we propose a novel one-hot encoding scheme that enables independent optimization of human joints. SkelSplat outperforms approaches that do not rely on 3D ground truth in Human3.6M and CMU, while reducing the cross-dataset error up to 47.8% compared to learning-based methods.

In image classification, such inconsistencies manifest as negative flips, where an updated model misclassifies test samples that were previously classified correctly. This issue becomes increasingly pronounced as the number of training classes grows over time, since adding new categories reduces the margin of each class and may introduce conflicting patterns that undermine their learning process, thereby degrading performance on the original subset. To mitigate negative flips, we propose a novel approach that preserves the margins of the original model while learning an improved one. Our method encourages a larger relative margin between the previously learned and newly introduced classes by introducing an explicit margin-calibration term on the logits. However, overly constraining the logit margin for the new classes can significantly degrade their accuracy compared to a new independently trained model. To address this, we integrate a double-source focal distillation loss with the previous model and a new independently trained model, learning an appropriate decision margin from both old and new data, even under a logit margin calibration.

By leveraging deep learning-based risk models, screening intervals can be personalized, especially for high-risk individuals. While recent methods increasingly incorporate longitudinal information from prior mammograms, accurate spatial alignment across time points remains a key challenge. Misalignment can obscure meaningful tissue changes and degrade model performance. In this study, we provide insights into various alignment strategies, image-based registration, feature-level (representation space) alignment with and without regularization, and implicit alignment methods, for their effectiveness in longitudinal deep learning-based risk modeling. Using two large-scale mammography datasets, we assess each method across key metrics, including predictive accuracy, precision, recall, and deformation field quality.\n  Our results show that image-based registration consistently outperforms the more recently favored feature-based and implicit approaches across all metrics, enabling more accurate, temporally consistent predictions and generating smooth, anatomically plausible deformation fields. Although regularizing the deformation field improves deformation quality, it reduces the risk prediction performance of feature-level alignment. Applying image-based deformation fields within the feature space yields the best risk prediction performance.\n  These findings underscore the importance of image-based deformation fields for spatial alignment in longitudinal risk modeling, offering improved prediction accuracy and robustness. This approach has strong potential to enhance personalized screening and enable earlier interventions for high-risk individuals.

However, sEMG-based systems often suffer from the scarcity of informative training data, leading to overfitting and poor generalization in deep learning models. Data augmentation offers a promising approach to increasing the size and diversity of training data, where faithfulness and diversity are two critical factors to effectiveness. However, promoting untargeted diversity can result in redundant samples with limited utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion-based data augmentation approach, Sparse-Aware Semantic-Guided Diffusion Augmentation (SASG-DA). To enhance generation faithfulness, we introduce the Semantic Representation Guidance (SRG) mechanism by leveraging fine-grained, task-aware semantic representations as generation conditions. To enable flexible and diverse sample generation, we propose a Gaussian Modeling Semantic Modeling (GMSS) strategy, which models the semantic representation distribution and allows stochastic sampling to produce both faithful and diverse samples. To enhance targeted diversity, we further introduce a Sparse-Aware Semantic Sampling strategy to explicitly explore underrepresented regions, improving distribution coverage and sample utility. Extensive experiments on benchmark sEMG datasets, Ninapro DB2, DB4, and DB7, demonstrate that SASG-DA significantly outperforms existing augmentation methods. Overall, our proposed data augmentation approach effectively mitigates overfitting and improves recognition performance and generalization by offering both faithful and diverse samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684sEMG\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5SASG-DA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "sEMG\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6548\u7528\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u6837\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSASG-DA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a1) \u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc(SRG)\u673a\u5236\u5229\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff1b2) \u9ad8\u65af\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u4e49\u5efa\u6a21(GMSS)\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\uff1b3) \u7a00\u758f\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u5f0f\u63a2\u7d22\u6b20\u8868\u793a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728Ninapro DB2\u3001DB4\u548cDB7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSASG-DA\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e2\u4fdd\u771f\u53c8\u591a\u6837\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86sEMG\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5eb7\u590d\u548c\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

While various retrospective motion correction methods exist, many struggle to generalize across different motion types and body regions. In particular, machine learning (ML)-based corrections are often tailored to specific applications and datasets. We hypothesize that motion artifacts, though diverse, share underlying patterns that can be disentangled and exploited. To address this, we propose a hierarchical vector-quantized (VQ) variational auto-encoder that learns a disentangled embedding of motion-to-clean image features. A codebook is deployed to capture finite collection of motion patterns at multiple resolutions, enabling coarse-to-fine correction. An auto-regressive model is trained to learn the prior distribution of motion-free images and is used at inference to guide the correction process. Unlike conventional approaches, our method does not require artifact-specific training and can generalize to unseen motion patterns. We demonstrate the approach on simulated whole-body motion artifacts and observe robust correction across varying motion severity. Our results suggest that the model effectively disentangled physical motion of the simulated motion-effective scans, therefore, improving the generalizability of the ML-based MRI motion correction. Our work of disentangling the motion features shed a light on its potential application across anatomical regions and motion types.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684MRI\u8fd0\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u90e8\u4f4d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7406\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f71\u54cdMRI\u8bca\u65ad\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u56de\u987e\u6027\u8fd0\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316(VQ)\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd0\u52a8\u5230\u5e72\u51c0\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u90e8\u7f72\u7801\u672c\u6355\u83b7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u6821\u6b63\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u8fd0\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6307\u5bfc\u6821\u6b63\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6821\u6b63\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u8026\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u8fd0\u52a8\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60MRI\u8fd0\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8de8\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7c7b\u578b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528MRI\u8fd0\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The success of RoPE has been thought to be due to its positional equivariance, i.e. its status as a relative positional encoding. In this paper, we mathematically show RoPE to be one of the most general solutions for equivariant positional embedding in one-dimensional data. Moreover, we show Mixed RoPE to be the analogously general solution for M-dimensional data, if we require commutative generators -- a property necessary for RoPE's equivariance. However, we question whether strict equivariance plays a large role in RoPE's performance. We propose Spherical RoPE, a method analogous to Mixed RoPE, but assumes non-commutative generators. Empirically, we find Spherical RoPE to have the equivalent or better learning behavior compared to its equivariant analogues. This suggests that relative positional embeddings are not as important as is commonly believed, at least within computer vision. We expect this discovery to facilitate future work in positional encodings for vision that can be faster and generalize better by removing the preconception that they must be relative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660eRoPE\u662f\u4e00\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6700\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faSpherical RoPE\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u7b49\u53d8\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u8ba4\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "RoPE\u5728NLP\u4e00\u7ef4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u5e76\u88ab\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u6210\u529f\u901a\u5e38\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8d28\u7591\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u662fRoPE\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660eRoPE\u662f\u4e00\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6700\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u8bc1\u660eMixed RoPE\u662fM\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4ea4\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u6700\u901a\u7528\u89e3\uff1b\u63d0\u51faSpherical RoPE\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u4ea4\u6362\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0Spherical RoPE\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5176\u7b49\u53d8\u7248\u672c\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5982\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u53d1\u73b0\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u89c9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u5fc5\u987b\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u5148\u5165\u4e4b\u89c1\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional Text-based Person Retrieval (T-PR), which focuses solely on ground-view images, TAG-PR introduces greater practical significance and presents unique challenges due to the large viewpoint discrepancy across images. To support this task, we contribute: (1) TAG-PEDES dataset, constructed from public benchmarks with automatically generated textual descriptions, enhanced by a diversified text generation paradigm to ensure robustness under view heterogeneity; and (2) TAG-CLIP, a novel retrieval framework that addresses view heterogeneity through a hierarchically-routed mixture of experts module to learn view-specific and view-agnostic features and a viewpoint decoupling strategy to decouple view-specific features for better cross-modal alignment. We evaluate the effectiveness of TAG-CLIP on both the proposed TAG-PEDES dataset and existing T-PR benchmarks.

Achieving expert-level diagnostic decisions requires integration of subtle image features with clinical knowledge. Yet major vision-language models (VLMs) treat images as holistic entities and overlook fine-grained image details that are vital for disease diagnosis. Clinicians analyze images by utilizing their prior medical knowledge and identify anatomical structures as important region of interests (ROIs). Inspired from this human-centric workflow, we introduce Anatomy-VLM, a fine-grained, vision-language model that incorporates multi-scale information. First, we design a model encoder to localize key anatomical features from entire medical images. Second, these regions are enriched with structured knowledge for contextually-aware interpretation. Finally, the model encoder aligns multi-scale medical information to generate clinically-interpretable disease prediction. Anatomy-VLM achieves outstanding performance on both in- and out-of-distribution datasets. We also validate the performance of Anatomy-VLM on downstream image segmentation tasks, suggesting that its fine-grained alignment captures anatomical and pathology-related knowledge. Furthermore, the Anatomy-VLM's encoder facilitates zero-shot anatomy-wise interpretation, providing its strong expert-level clinical interpretation capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Anatomy-VLM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u5f71\u50cf\u89c6\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u533b\u751f\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u533b\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8bc6\u522b\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "Anatomy-VLM\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\uff1a1)\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u6574\u5f20\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2)\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ed3\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b3)\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u9f50\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "Anatomy-VLM\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89e3\u5256\u7ea7\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u4e34\u5e8a\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Anatomy-VLM\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u6210\u529f\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u548c\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u533b\u751f\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u75be\u75c5\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

An effective embedding is expected to comprehensively preserve the semantic content of the input while simultaneously emphasizing features that are discriminative for downstream tasks. Recent approaches demonstrate that VLMs can be adapted into competitive embedding models via large-scale contrastive learning, enabling the simultaneous optimization of two complementary objectives. We argue that the two aforementioned objectives can be decoupled: a comprehensive understanding of the input facilitates the embedding model in achieving superior performance in downstream tasks via contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose CoMa, a compressed pre-training phase, which serves as a warm-up stage for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrate that with only a small amount of pre-training data, we can transform a VLM into a competitive embedding model.

Website: https://univa.online/", "summary": "While specialized AI models excel at isolated video tasks like generation or understanding, real-world applications demand complex, iterative workflows that combine these capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce UniVA, an open-source, omni-capable multi-agent framework for next-generation video generalists that unifies video understanding, segmentation, editing, and generation into cohesive workflows. UniVA employs a Plan-and-Act dual-agent architecture that drives a highly automated and proactive workflow: a planner agent interprets user intentions and decomposes them into structured video-processing steps, while executor agents execute these through modular, MCP-based tool servers (for analysis, generation, editing, tracking, etc.). Through a hierarchical multi-level memory (global knowledge, task context, and user-specific preferences), UniVA sustains long-horizon reasoning, contextual continuity, and inter-agent communication, enabling interactive and self-reflective video creation with full traceability. This design enables iterative and any-conditioned video workflows (e.g., text/image/video-conditioned generation $\\rightarrow$ multi-round editing $\\rightarrow$ object segmentation $\\rightarrow$ compositional synthesis) that were previously cumbersome to achieve with single-purpose models or monolithic video-language models. We also introduce UniVA-Bench, a benchmark suite of multi-step video tasks spanning understanding, editing, segmentation, and generation, to rigorously evaluate such agentic video systems. Both UniVA and UniVA-Bench are fully open-sourced, aiming to catalyze research on interactive, agentic, and general-purpose video intelligence for the next generation of multimodal AI systems.

Unlike existing sign language recognition methods that rely on 2D video, our approach directly utilizes 3D sign language data to capture rich spatial, gestural, and depth information in 3D scenes. This enables more accurate and resilient translation, enhancing digital communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired community. Beyond the task of ASL translation, our work explores the integration of complex, embodied multimodal languages into the processing capabilities of LLMs, moving beyond purely text-based inputs to broaden their understanding of human communication. We investigate both direct translation from 3D gesture features to text and an instruction-guided setting where translations can be modulated by external prompts, offering greater flexibility.

However, obtaining precise camera poses in real-world settings remains challenging, even when calibration parameters are known. This limits the practicality of existing NeRF-based methods that rely heavily on accurate extrinsic estimates. Furthermore, their implicit volumetric representations differ significantly from the widely adopted polygonal meshes, making rendering and manipulation inefficient in standard 3D software. In this work, we propose a robust framework that reconstructs high-quality, editable 3D meshes directly from multi-view images with noisy extrinsic parameters. Our approach jointly refines camera poses while learning an implicit scene representation that captures fine geometric detail and photorealistic appearance. The resulting meshes are compatible with common 3D graphics and robotics tools, enabling efficient downstream use. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves accurate and robust 3D reconstruction under pose uncertainty, bridging the gap between neural implicit representations and practical robotic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u5e26\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u673a\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u51fa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u76843D\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u9690\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eNeRF\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u7cbe\u786e\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u9690\u5f0f\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u7f51\u683c\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u6807\u51c63D\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u9690\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u903c\u771f\u7684\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c13D\u56fe\u5f62\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5de5\u5177\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4d\u59ff\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u73af\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Integrating this functional information present in transcriptomic data with structural data from histopathology images is an active research area with applications in identifying tumor substructures associated with cancer drug resistance. Current histopathology-spatial-transcriptomic region segmentation methods suffer due to either making spatial transcriptomics prominent by using histopathology features just to assist processing spatial transcriptomics data or using vanilla contrastive learning that make histopathology images prominent due to only promoting common features losing functional information. In both extremes, the model gets either lost in the noise of spatial transcriptomics or overly smoothed, losing essential information. Thus, we propose our novel architecture SENCA-st (Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention) that preserves the features of both modalities. More importantly, it emphasizes regions that are structurally similar in histopathology but functionally different on spatial transcriptomics using cross-attention. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting tumor heterogeneity and tumor micro-environment regions, a clinically crucial aspect.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSENCA-st\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5728\u80bf\u7624\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u5fae\u73af\u5883\u533a\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u6781\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f3a\u8c03\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u800c\u5c06\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u5206\u7a81\u51fa\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u800c\u4e22\u5931\u529f\u80fd\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u6781\u7aef\u90fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u9677\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u800c\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u764c\u75c7\u8010\u836f\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u4e9a\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSENCA-st\uff08Shared Encoder with Neighborhood Cross Attention\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u5f15\u5165\u90bb\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4e0a\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e0a\u529f\u80fd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u6355\u83b7\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eSENCA-st\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u80bf\u7624\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u80bf\u7624\u5fae\u73af\u5883\u533a\u57df\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SENCA-st\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5e73\u8861\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5b66\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u764c\u75c7\u8010\u836f\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u80bf\u7624\u4e9a\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}
